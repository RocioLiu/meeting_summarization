So we're gonna have like individual work and then a meeting about it . And repeat that process three times .  So you get to draw your favourite animal and sum up your favourite characteristics of it . Speaker marketing expert: My favourite animal is like  A beagle . , right , well basically high priority for any animal for me is that they be willing to take a lot of physical affection from their family . And , yeah that they have lots of personality Speaker user interface: Well , my favourite animal would be a monkey . Then they're small cute and furry , Speaker industrial designer: and I kind of like whales . They come in and go  eat everything in sight .  Speaker project manager: M my favourite animal is my own dog at home . he's very friendly and cheery and always pleased to see you ,",

Speaker marketing expert: but selling price is  is that wholesale or retail ? Speaker project manager: I imagine it probably is our sale actually because it's probably up to the the the retailer to sell it for whatever price they want . . I mean do you think the fact that it's going to be sold internationally will have a bearing on how we design it at all ? Like how much does , you know , a remote control cost . Well twenty five Euro , I mean that's that's about like eighteen pounds or something , Speaker marketing expert: thi is this gonna to be like the premium product kinda thing or  Speaker project manager: so I don't know how how good a remote control that would get you . .",

Speaker marketing expert: I'm thinking the price might might appeal to a certain market in one region , whereas in another it'll be different , so  thinking , 'kay trendy probably means something other than just basic , Speaker project manager: But yeah , I suppose it has to look kind of cool and gimmicky . So extra functionalities . Speaker marketing expert: So , like , I wonder if we might add something new to the to the remote control market , so in function one of the priorities might be to combine as many uses  Speaker project manager: Right , so do you think that should be like a main design aim of our remote control d you know , do your your satellite and your regular telly and your V_C_R_ and everything ? Speaker marketing expert: maybe what we could use is a sort of like a example of a successful other piece technology is palm palm pilots . Speaker project manager: W You get those ones where you can , if you like , whistle or make a really high pitched noise they beep . Speaker marketing expert: Maybe we could think about how , could be more , you know , streamlined . S Speaker project manager: Maybe like a touch screen or something ?

I think the worry is that if the project becomes too complex then it'll affect how long it takes us to get it into into production , the time to market . So , we're just gonna keep it simple and it'll just control the T_V_ . And the other thing was that the company want the corporate colour and slogan to be implemented in the new design . I'm not entirely sure what the corporate colour is . It might be yellow , because there seems to be a lot of yellow everywhere . Speaker marketing expert: And the slogan , like the actual written slogan , or just to embody the idea of the slogan ? Speaker project manager:  th because on the the company website , what does it say  Speaker marketing expert: 'Bout putting the fashion in electronics . Speaker project manager: I mean do they   Is that something they want actually written on it , 'cause it's quite long . So those are the three things , just not to worry about teletext , only control the T_V_ , and and incorporate the colour and slogan of the company .",

That one's perg and that one's prog , and it doesn't really tell you what it does . , not sure if you had a a look at the other control in that example . it's a very simple one .

They're very big and not very much use for  buttons . and it's just very hard to access the advanced functions . , my own preferences , I prefer the the clunky one .  so I believe the the advanced functions should maybe be hidden in a drawer , So ,  now I'd like to ask for your preferences . Speaker industrial designer: Which which is the clunky one , the one on left or on the right?. . Speaker user interface:  , the clunky one is the one on the right .

I mean like the one on the left looks quite quite complicated , so I see I see why yo you know you might prefer the simpler design , you know you get a lot of remote controls where you kind of flip the thing open , Speaker user interface: ,  do we have any functions that we'd want on it ? I mean so far I've got on and off , switch the channel up and down , and put the volume up and down . Speaker project manager: and then actual numbers for channels as well , yeah . Speaker user interface: , you say that's a h a required one or a requested one ? Speaker project manager: God , I wou I would say that's required , I mean there's no way anybody's gonna buy a remote control these days when if you can't actually individually select channels , any kind of like display controls at all do you think we need to worry about , Speaker marketing expert: Well I think I think es essentially what we're doing right now is we're categorising . We're saying well we want this to be a product that offers all the sort of more tricky features but we want them to be in another area ? Speaker user interface: we need to find out exactly what we have to have and after that we can add things if they're possible . There's on and off , volume and channel , and skip to certain channels with the numbers . Speaker project manager: , so so far , just to recap you've got volume and channel control and  Speaker marketing expert: Well , one one way I would look at this would be that we a approach the different controls in terms of like control types , so that for the user it's very clear what they want to do where they go . and also think maybe a little bit about sorta w w what would just wanna be acc easily accessible . For example if we had audio controls , those could be something people set up very rarely . Maybe they're they're they're they're in a little area but covered up , things like channel and volume are used all the time , so we just have them right out on top , so maybe we need to think about having three or more groupings of controls , you know like one which are just the the habitual ones that should be right within your natural grip . Speaker project manager: and then maybe just things that would be nice if it could do would be things like audio set up and display set up and things like that , maybe like a mute button ,",

Speaker marketing expert: Before I bring this up what I'll just say is what I've what I've done is tried to collect some information so that I can then relay this to to you guys so that it's  now becomes a collective thing . And then kind of lead us in the direction of deciding , 'kay what what are our options , what should we decide So what I basically got is I just looked into some information and sort of th tried to think about how how we could review it and what kind of decisions we could take away from it So I'm thinking here about primarily about customer needs , and what are issues with with existing products . and also about  try and connect that as you see with the company vision So this is what I've found here , , users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls . Most people find them ugly .  the vast majority would spend more money for it to look fancy as well , we'll see later , the vast majority would spend more money for slightly more intuitive control , such as voice recognition . most people use only a f a very slim portion of all the controls . they tend to use the most simple controls if for me this is sorta like three different different inspirations , you know , one is that we want something that's high-tech but we want it to seem easy . And in spite of the primitive side of it and the very high-tech side , we want it to just be an appealing piece of equipment in people's hands . They get lost a lot , , takes time to learn how to use them . and I will admit I don't know what R_S_I_ stands for . adults at least would pay more for voice recognition . Now apparently we do have access to all the tech cutting edge technology in remote control . if that's possible we might consider getting into it . I think a recurring theme here is the company wants it to be  wants us to make something that's fashionable and sleek and trendy . You know , they like the aesthetics and the ergonomics . Speaker project manager: So it  you wanna group all the different kind of types of functions together , you know . Speaker marketing expert: my hope here is that I'm putting out this information so that we can then say okay , well how do we collectively move on with it . I I haven't brought out one specific marketing idea , Speaker project manager:  Well , one of the things that we have to decide on by the end of the meeting is who we're gonna be  who's our our target audience , our target market . , so if we want something that that looks good and is easy to use , but has y is fairly powerful product , whatever , who do we really want to aim that at ? Speaker marketing expert: Where's the money , maybe . Speaker project manager: Yeah , who wou who would have the money to spend . it's somebody who's not gonna just use the remote that comes with their telly , I suppose , Speaker industrial designer: , I think it'll be the mid range to the high end market , in terms of people . so maybe not the high end range , but maybe middle , middle up-ish . 'Cause twenty five Euros for a remote , how much is that lo locally in pounds ? is that a lot of money to buy an extra remote or a replacement remote ? Speaker marketing expert: Mostly focused around the twenty five age group . Sort of young professional , kind of . Mm-hmm Speaker project manager: do you think then voice recognition is something we should really seriously consider ? Speaker marketing expert: It does it does fit with the market that we're sort of identifying , Speaker project manager: I think we are gonna have to narrow it down , and 'cause you know , there needs to be some kind of selling point to it . if we are going to include speech recognition , it's kind of between fifteen and thirty five seems to be like a really high response to that . Speaker industrial designer: I I think twenty five to thirty five is is is fair to add that in as a group as well Speaker project manager: Okay , so fifteen to thirty five , look fairly young . Speaker industrial designer: So these are people who are gadgety , right ? Speaker project manager: So they'll not sh not shy away from something quite high-tech . so shall we make the decision to include speech recognition Speaker industrial designer: I I think one thing we should try not to avoid is not to say we have to use speech recognition right now , because , based on what you've go y everybody's saying , right , you want something simple . Speech recognition might not be the simplest thing for somebody to use . Speaker marketing expert: Could it be an on off thing ? Speaker industrial designer: but what I'm saying is that we're we're trying to lock ourselves into a s particular kind of technology , rather than focusing on on exactly what are the features that we're gonna say , and then , you know , say speech recognition is good for this , speech recognition is not good for this . but at end of the day we don't look at the technology , but we look at the function first . Speaker project manager: is if we make it speech reco if we incorporate speech recognition , that's appealing to people maybe with a physical disability as well . Speaker marketing expert: And also it helps in terms of people not losing this , Speaker user interface: I reckon one problem with speech recognition is I've actually seen one of them used and the technology that was in that one wasn't particularly amazing , so you end up yelling at the control for hours . Speaker project manager: Do you think maybe we need like further advances in that kind of area until it's worthwhile incorporating it though ? Speaker user interface: I think it'd probably quite expensive to put in .",

I guess I try to define like what we're doing now , but we're  we can't n we haven't narrowed down exactly what the things we're trying to fulfil , like  I think back  in the back of our minds we know what the basics are . Has to change channels , has to change volume , but in like specifics , right , which one of the basics are you trying to target . so I'll go into the diagram first . It just explains how the process goes through , from the basic technology point of view , the basic steps that you need you need some power source . 'Kay , a battery or something , to keep it going . and that power source is important because it ties you down to how long the device will last . Like for example , voice recognition , right . That might be constrained because that  you might need to power a microphone , so that's one perhaps constraint there .  Th Okay , the basic thing is there's a user interface You know , and that picks up an input from a user , a series of logic has to decide what the user is telling the device , and then it needs to be able to send the signal out to the device itself like voice recognition , right , if it's something which is important then we just add more power rather than having a thing that we don't have enough power . maybe you you wanna go back to what the functions are ? Speaker project manager: Well , do you wan do you wanna finish up your your whole presentation then ? Speaker industrial designer: Yeah , w I'm done . you have a transmitter , an input device , logic chip , Speaker marketing expert: Since we're on the topic of the technology , are there any like  what are our options ? Is this the only way that we go about it , or are there other thin Speaker industrial designer: , these these aren't technology options in that sense . a basic principles and basic components that are needed . So each component represents one function , but I think the basic functions are the logic , the transmitter , and the receiver , okay , and the power are things that you won't have to care about . there might be one other consideration which would be that the the transmission between the remote control and the T_V_ for example . Okay , are we gonna restrict ourselves to using the traditional technologies of infra-red thing ? Because that's something you need to actually be physically be pointing to . Right . Speaker project manager: Well well a worry that was was expressed in the new requirements was that if we made this too complex it would e it would effect how long how long it took us to get this to market , so I th suspect it might be a good idea just to restrict our kind of our creative influence on this on the user interface because I mean it it's tried and tested intra-red , so we could stay with tha Speaker industrial designer: if somebody's gonna h talk to the device , you ideally want them to hold it to them . so because if you're using infra-red , the line of sight say the T_V_'s at that chair , and I'm standing in front of here and the transmitter is here , it blocks it . Speaker marketing expert: does c is our controller is it have the option of being on a standard frequency as all of the other equipment , Speaker industrial designer: There's there's not much specific specific information , Speaker project manager: In the new requirement spec they said just to focus on the T_V_ , , is it worth considering like having like a charging unit as opposed to just regular batteries ? or should we just consider running on regular batteries ? Speaker industrial designer: Okay , from from a from a component point of view there's added complexity , and you add cost to it , You need a docking cradle , for example , for you to put it in to charge . Or you need to get the user to plug it in . and most users are very f use already used to the idea of buying batteries and putting it into the controller . then I don't think rechargeable is something we should  you know , we really need to care about .

Speaker user interface: I think we just say that it was gonna be the the most basic stuff possible . on off , up and down channels , up and down volume and skip to a channel . Speaker project manager: and also the funct the the actual functions of what it's gonna do .

Speaker industrial designer: Another thing that you were saying about categorising the controls ? maybe I could suggest we we break them down into three simple categories . One would be audio controls , one would be video controls , and the other one would be a device . I mean like so what we could have is like three buckets , right , where we could throw things into , and then from there decide whether it's basic , or it's non-basic . Speaker marketing expert: okay , great . Speaker industrial designer: Device is basically anything which we can't categorise , right . Speaker marketing expert: shall we agree for sake of sort of clarity and when we when we r resume that we'll u use this idea David's proposed , where we think of these three sort of buckets and anything anything we discuss about them is sort of , okay , we're talking about this . Speaker project manager: Yeah , yeah I think that's definitely a good idea . so you're gonna have audio which is gonna be like you know your bass settings and actual volume  hi Speaker industrial designer: And then video is anything that you can see . Speaker project manager: Okay , so brightness , contrast , things like that , Speaker marketing expert: And then k I suppose quite likely what would happen is in the d device category there might be some which are just like the habitual standard Speaker project manager: so yeah , I guess just things to think about are you know like the fact it's gotta look good , something maybe kind of quirky in design maybe .

Number two was that it be innovative . and third priority for ease of use , is that I think  what we should think about is how the  about how the innovation contributes to the look and feel , and not so much to the functionality of it . top European fashion trend  that I read about says there's this emerging theme of fruit and vegetables , okay , especially in clothes and furniture . So my my feeling is that we w do want to observe this trend , And then in terms of m material trends are for things to be soft and spongy and sort of , you might say ergonomic or or friendly to handle , And then at the end there are vibrant natural colours softness in materials , shape , and function , so I'm thinking if we imagine that we're taking some of the features of a Mac iPod and we're then making it s more of like a more of like a comfortable type of we think of some kind of a thin theme that unifies it all , sorta like a marketing identity .

And the power is basically a factor of that . and the lower components , the power , the logic , the transmitter , and the infrared , they affect you in terms of the size of your device , So I guess three things , cost , complexity , and the size . I'm not very sure about the voice thing 'cause I got another email and it was in fact quite sketchy on what n the voice options are . it said it could talk to you , but it never said anything about being able to listen . I it said something about a sensor but never clarified that . Okay so your basic components are buttons , okay and you have a wheel available , like a mouse scroll wheel , okay there's an L_C_D_ display , Okay then there's how the case actually looks . It can actually be flat or it can be curved , and then the different types of materials that you can use , I don't think you can use them in a combination , I think plastic and rubber would be fine , but plastic , rubber , and wood , the rubber was a restriction on the kind of power source you could use , but the titanium had a different kind of things on the shape of the thing , but you know it might be easier from a cost perspective and a complexity just to use one . and the other components are logic chips , again I'll I'll go back to the component chips . The com how complex or how easy the logic is , it depends on how many functions you have on the on the unit I don't think the logic chip has a issue about size 'cause they should be about the same size . Power consumption should be about the same . and the other thing is the power options . the first one is a standard battery . Okay the second one I think is more of a gimmick then actually a useable thing , it's a wind-up  you know , a crank  . I think that's more of a look and feel decision because I don't think you can have one power source if you're using the alternative power sources . I think whatever it is you still need a battery Okay the other ones are a solar powered cell , and the kinetic one I guess for me is the most interesting one you have  you had those balls , you know those stress balls where you bounce the ball and it and it lights up and it goes , you know that might be a gimmick combined with rubber . I guess that's more in the sense of  small and slim in terms of comfortable not so small you can't , you know like a phone or something , too small phone . the less components we use and the simpler the components means you reduce your cost and you increase your profit . and also the time to market and the complexity of developing designing and debugging it  so . The user interface restrictions basically means that if you use more complicated features , like the buttons are standard okay , the L_C_D_ panel and the scroll wheel you need more complicated logic .  the case  okay with a rubber case you can't have the solar panels . titanium case can't be curved , it has to be square . Okay there's no restriction on the plastic , and on the wood . I think we could because the L_C_D_ panel requires power , and the L_C_D_ is a form of a light",

Speaker project manager: So something quite curvy ? about how if you have a bright colour you'll not lose it so much . and when the corporate colour is yellow , I mean maybe we could think about about the colour of the whole product being yellow Speaker marketing expert: So for the look and feel to seem coherent and not just sorta bits and bits and pieces of of concept and technology or or whatever or fashion , then we should have it kind of come back to one thing that we kind of all sorta can visualize . maybe what we could do is t th think about a concept which touches b back to the  on the  the colour , Speaker project manager: 'Cause I I I was kinda thinking about as well  you know how you get these shock resistant mobile phones , and they're plastic but then also have like rubber on the outside , and it kinda feels  it feels kind of warmer to the touch . It feels a bit more comfortable , and maybe we could incorporate plastic and rubber into it . Speaker user interface: I'd quite like a sort of snowman type shape . so a p sort of larger bit sits in your hand , and then you got maybe another bubble at the top for just any other function you need . So I reckon it'd look quite nice if we just had this  here , had a sorta background yellow , and then have sort of a nice bold colour for the buttons . Speaker project manager: The fact that it talks to you , I mean it might be quite cool if when you first start using it it says , what is it , putting fashion into electronics or something , Speaker user interface: I think that'd probably scare me . Speaker project manager: also would that work if we wanted to incorporate an L_C_D_ display , where would we put that ? Speaker industrial designer: Do we need an L_C_D_ display ? Speaker project manager: It's bound to increase the cost of it a lot , I would've thought . Speaker industrial designer: what would we what would we achieve from it ? Speaker marketing expert: And the th the thing I could see it helping with would be if it was somehow connected with listings . So as you scroll through , 'cause we said we might have a jog dial , so as you scroll through your stations you can y it actually tells you what it is . Speaker industrial designer: I think that will be a problem because we don't have an input device to get the listings into it , Speaker project manager: I would say no need for a talk-back . I mean do you wanna group them into s head of the snowman , body of the snowman , inside of the snowman , Speaker user interface:  well I think the advanced ones the the ones you don't usually use could be hid inside . Speaker industrial designer: Where would you physically position the buttons ? Speaker project manager: energy what  do you think that's suggesting we're  how we're powering the thing ? I really like the idea of this kinetic thing where you'd have the back-up of the battery , but have have kinetic power , Speaker marketing expert: And this size here , I'd suggest this be small , like quite small . Speaker project manager: I know we're gonna have like rubber buttons Speaker marketing expert: but we are leaning quite a bit to the side of being low-tech , rubber buttons plastic frame , it's almost like we're reproducing the same old remote control that's out there . Okay so so backlighting , that would be good . Speaker industrial designer: you know a a glowing a a glowing yellow type case where the yellow is showable , Speaker project manager: S so like cur slightly transparent case , so it's yellow , like tinted yellow , but you can maybe see through it . Speaker industrial designer: Or or there might be a light running through it like a mouse . but because the case is transparent so it gives it a little bit of a glow , doesn't make it freaky . Speaker marketing expert: and then the other thing that we we're s we've committed ourselves to achieving is simplicity , 'cause that's the main thing people will f wanna do . Could we use like a jog dial , like a nice just sort of round , somewhere on it where you just roll it ? Speaker industrial designer: The question is when you're rolling it , how do you wanna roll it ? 'Cause in a mouse your hand's in a position to roll it , whereas the other thing about having it jog dial this way , it tends to get moved accidentally . Can you imagine you have to scroll a lot . it might work for volume , but not for channels right . and maybe some of the brightness controls and stuff like that , Speaker project manager: And the other thing was can we think of any way of getting the slogan into this thing ? Speaker marketing expert: and that we've got like the the l slogan somewhere like on the casing at the side , Speaker industrial designer: That that might have one problem in terms of in terms of whether you're left handed or you're right handed you might be locking yourself in . Speaker marketing expert: Yeah I think the jog dial , what if it was flat and you just spun it , Speaker industrial designer: a slide , because then you you don't have to put the hand . Speaker marketing expert: and I think maybe we should try and stay away from just the big protruding rubber buttons , 'cause that'd just be so standard . and also t plastic I've seen can get really textured , so you can get plastics that actually feel soft in your hand . Speaker industrial designer: Feel like fruit .",

Speaker user interface: , there are a few changes we've made . , well look at the expense sheet , and it turned to be quite a lot expensive to have open up and have lots of buttons and stuff inside , this is gonna be an L_C_D_ screen , just a a very very basic one , very small with access to the menu through the the scroll wheel and confirm , apart from that , it's just pretty much the same as we discussed last time . Speaker industrial designer: the advanced functions are still hidden from you , but they're hidden in the sense that they're not in use . they're in the L_C_D_ panel and the jog-dial ? The L_C_D_ panel just displays functionally what you're doing . If you're using an advanced function right , like c brightness , contrast , whatever , it will just say  It might even be one , a bit more complex L_C_D_ panel with pictures like maybe the sun or the , you know , the the symbols of the various functions . That's a number pad . Speaker project manager: Where are we gonna have the slogan ? Speaker user interface: just like right inside there .  Well  we want the other buttons to be big enough to push easily with a finger so we reckon maybe that'll be about the same size as the palm of your hand .  Speaker project manager: So we're talking about ten centimetres . Speaker user interface: We're gonna have again the the sort of the foggy yellow from last time that lit up when you pushed the button . this button , because it's red it's sort of very prominent , we're gonna use it as  it can be the power button if you hold it for maybe two seconds it'll send a stand-by signal . apart from that it's gonna be used as a confirm button for the L_C_D_ screen Speaker industrial designer: Oh we've discussed how h high it is , but how wide is it ?  be about th three and a half . Speaker project manager: what else can you do ? Speaker user interface: you can skip straight to a channel using these buttons . but because we've got the the L_C_D_ and the jog-dial we just thought we'd use that as the volume . you can use it for more advanced functions like contrast , colour and  Speaker project manager: And what else do you do with the jog-dial ?

Speaker user interface: it's it is quite a lot of fun t to go and then you have sort of hit the end then go right , gotta cut everything out 'cause we don't have enough money . Speaker industrial designer: and I think the fact that we're wearing these things restricts  it it it does actually you know affect how , w whether you feel comfortable to communicate . and and the time the time given also restricts  Speaker marketing expert: In in reality I think here the the different elements of leadership such as the the original b briefing and then the personal coach and the and then you know having having you with your  the meeting agenda is actually quite a quite a  quite a con confining framework to work within . And so it is leadership almost to the point of sort of disempowering the the the team member , so  But it's not bad leadership , it's just sort of s fairly strong , you know . Speaker industrial designer: I think the interactions are very structured . Speaker project manager: So you think maybe a little too controlling or  Speaker marketing expert: Yeah , oh yeah , without without a doubt . Speaker industrial designer: I don't think there's a sense of control 'cause all the decisions have been made in terms of a , like a consensus right , we go around and we think about it , Speaker project manager: what about teamwork ? Speaker user interface: , reckon that was a bit hard because we could only discuss things in the meeting . Speaker marketing expert: I think the whiteboard , for me , is the kind of thing I would use all the time , maybe just in the way that we we use it , in the sense that once we have an idea out there or while work was going on in between meetings , that could have been up on a board you know as opposed to in like in text . I know that people who design cars and you know in aviation they quite often just have a simple like fibreglass prototype and it's completely you know abs abstract from the final product , but they use it as a kind of a context to sort of walk around and puzzle and and point and discuss and in a way everybody's  as we discuss things in the  in theoretically and out of our notebooks , we're actually just each of us discussing something that's in each of our own minds . Speaker industrial designer: I think the the focus of it a lot was the PowerPoint as opposed to the to the whiteboard , and I think that m is also does you know hinder us and things I think . And a lot of the information on the PowerPoints , I don't think , you know , we needed to actually  it could have , we could have gone through it  verbally , Speaker project manager: What about the digital pens , did you find them easy enough to use ? Speaker user interface: Oh they're a bit clunky . Speaker industrial designer: Having to tick it before you go off was a bit hindering as well , But I think the pen is v is very intuitive , So I think the pen's good .

We only actually needed one computer .

And therefore putting it into a well much lower price bracket . Speaker project manager: with the price range we're looking at , going for a touch screen would probably be possibly out of our  Speaker user interface: Absolutely prohibitive , Speaker project manager: But you think again something to control multiple units in a simple fashion . Speaker user interface: I mean you get ones that you can switch between multiple units , and ideally something into which it would have some at least limited facility for  running macros . Speaker project manager: Would the the idea something along the lines of , one on button would turn on say the video recorder , the T_V_ , maybe the sound system as well , all in one go , is that kind of  Speaker user interface: you pr you press say the play button for the D_V_D_ player and it turns the T_V_ on and onto the right channel as well , Speaker marketing expert: I've noticed that gaming c is becoming quite popular with television , we used to e play games using our cable , using the cable subscribed the cable providers , but our remote controls would get worn out really easily , Speaker project manager: I've seen the bar-code design before , Speaker marketing expert: Instead of people entering in what time things start , you simply stri slide a bar to say what time it begins , and  the remote control was not a great kind of keyboar , keypad , for playing games . I think for gaming , you know you want you want some big buttons for up , down , left and right , shoot . , you wanna be able to change angles in interactive television , Speaker project manager: so  we'll have to try and decide on some of the basic functionality , that'll be a key aspect especially if the idea of some kind of macros facility Speaker industrial designer: do you think they should have some sort of stick on it , rather than buttons ? Like control pads , you know of games , Speaker project manager: and that could allow n easy navigation , used as a joystick as well . Speaker user interface: Mm-hmm . The other key feature that that would be a good idea built into it is t is is to make something you know fairly sort of ergonomic , something that just fits  fits as comfortably as possible into the hand .

I'm pretty sure people would buy it . I mean most people use a remote control for switching to channels , So if you have to say up , up , up , up , if you have to do that all the time , then people might get a bit fed up with that  However ,  oh , because the voice recognition software exists already , there's no need to spend money on research and development , but this does mean the need for microphones in the in the remote control , which is an unusual feature in my opinion . But if we do have the voice recognition thing , there's a lot of stuff that you can get rid of . there're two options . Either you have voice recognition by itself , which I think is a bit impractical for like night time if you wanna be watching television and you wanna be quiet , or I don't know you have a visitor coming round and the remote's only trained for you , it's a bit impractical to have just voice recognition by itself . So you can have voice recognition and a regular remote . But imagine you got rid of the regular remote part , then you can design the remote to look any way you want it to look , but is it practical to have a voice recognition system in a remote control , , will people will people be willing to wait for the the period that it'll take to train the remote ,  I think a lot of young people will buy the remote control , if they have the money , but would they return it after a while",

On the one hand  and this this particularly relates to its sort of earliest models where with you know i so so many buttons on it giving you every possible function that the that the device has , the remote control controls . it creates a rather user unfriendly interface . And on the other hand there's a user focused approach that pares things down to just what  what is most likely to get used .  and of course there is a certain amount of sort of loss of function here obviously , And so you go for something that's fairly intuitive to use , My own view is that we should definitely be going for a user focused design . but the pro  I think the problem with a lot of the sort of user focused designs that are about is that they sort of make assumptions in advance about what what a given user's going to want mo want to do from  want it to do most . something that's  something that is more programmable , that perh perhaps has the full range of functions available to it but you can then specify yourself what you're most likely to want . I liked Ebenezer's idea of including a joystick in that and possibly a sort of fairly minimal number of sort of function buttons , you then have some sort of basic display on it so that if you're sort of cha changing from different modes for the device it'll tell you just exactly what you know each direction of the of the joystick's  going to do or wha or what each function button's going to do .",

The power required , and the ability to the cost , it seems like for an embedded system , this could cause us issues . voice activation could be an interesting idea but I think that our Ind Industrial Designer would probably upon some research say that it's maybe not feasible . however the idea of a joystick and then maybe an L_C_D_ which has been kind of put forward so far , but if you can control almost all of the functionality from the display , I don't know how much power an L_C_D_ would take , literally if you can imagine the display maybe slightly larger than those on a  a mobile phone , something where you can read an an fair amount of information , traverse maybe quite a few menus , and then we could have like say the common buttons as you say , volume control , changing channels  Speaker user interface:  I I was thinking that the remote  the  sort of default functions for the joystick would be up and down for volume , left and right for channels . Speaker industrial designer: Do you think that people will get mixed up , they'll be looking at this screen and that screen Speaker user interface: I think probably for the first couple of hours of using it but we should probably try to stick to black and white . Si si simply to keep m keep the unit cost down . Speaker project manager: I imagine as well that the actual L_C_D_ and maybe to a certain extent the joystick as well would be for the additional functionality . and you can still have the main buttons that allow the people to turn the machine on and off , d up and down , maybe we have the fol the joystick as a separate one for the other functions then , that there's just a a small number of as you were saying buttons that have already been defined . we go for the nice standard up and down for and volume control . Speaker user interface: if you i if you wanted to access further functions i  you you then get to sort of menu navigation . I mean with things like ch with things like tuning and channels you know adjusting brightn brightness and  fiddly things that no one really bothers with , most T_V_s these days actually have menus anyway Speaker project manager: something else that you brought up was the ability to lose a remote , but have any of you ever seen those odd little key rings where if you whistle , it will beep and you  tell you where it is . Speaker marketing expert: I had one of those , because it it went off all the time accidentally . Speaker project manager: the other option of course is that the Speaker marketing expert: The clapping one .  Speaker project manager: digital telephones , for example , one unit has  somewhere where there's a button , of course you have to have that base unit , but maybe it's a button that you attach to the T_V_ . Something which you when you press that , it would beep to give its location away , on the remote unit . again say what , it would be a small transmitter , watch battery type scenario I would say , that might be something that we could look into . that could be something that separates us a bit from the market as well .",

Speaker industrial designer: Should volume be important in the joystick , do you think ? Speaker project manager: We could use say the left and right for changing channels we could maybe even go as far as saying power button , small joystick , L_C_D_ , and with the possibility of pushing down on the joystick to say okay ?

Probably plastic . we need the infra-red transmitter . joystick we'll probably if we're gonna use it , could be plastic w or rubber even as well . three different types of batteries . can either use a hand dynamo , or the kinetic type ones , you know that they use in watches , or else a solar powered one . Speaker project manager: the bat the battery for a a watch wouldn't require a lot of power , would be my one query . Is a kinetic one going to be able to supply enough power ? Speaker industrial designer: And solar cells , I dunno about that . . We should probably just use conventional batteries . , just like in usual remote controls . .  And these are three different types of  or two different types  three different types of shapes you can have . one is a flat one , and then more original ones are single curved one or one with a double curved . but you can't have a titanium one for a double curved , Speaker project manager: the single curved and double curved , would you be able to give an example ? Speaker industrial designer: Double curved . It probably means  this is probably double curved . whereas a single curved would be like that . it looks better than the single curve , but you can't have it in titanium , and for the buttons , it can have the scroll wheel but it requires a more expensive chip to use , and if you wanna use L_C_D_ it's even more expensive . there's trade-offs there . you have to decide , if you have a double curve control and it's rubber , then you have these rubber buttons as well . I reckon you're gonna have to have key a number keypad anyway for the amount of channels these days . Speaker project manager: like when we're saying that we'd need an advanced chip for an L_C_D_ , does that in shoot the cost up by a drastic amount ? Or ? We have to look into the costs of those . Speaker industrial designer: the previous slides just explain what's in the internal components of the remote control . And then the next slide just shows how the copper wires interact with the buttons , the rubber buttons , to get sent to the chip . translate the key press into an infra-red signal and this is received by the T_V_ . Speaker project manager: in the information that you've been supplied , how feasible would you say that the idea of using an L_C_D_ looks ?

I wasn't very impressed by them nothing I saw seemed to meet the sorts of design specifications that we're going for today . rather than looking at other remotes , ra oomp be better to simply look at the human hand . so that if r a if  so that the finger is e each finger or thumb is wherever it needs to be already . and what we've basically decided on was the the the joy the joystick , two function buttons and the L_C_D_ , I don't actually think we need the the numeric keypad because one of the menus that we could have available  v via via the L_C_D_ is one where you scroll through channels , You must have two two modes , basic mode , where the joystick's left right  left right for channels , up down for volume , and the and the menu mode for further functions . now the reason I was particularly interested in using rubber for this is that if we're going to have a highly ergonomic design , it needs to be ergonomic for left or right handed people . Speaker project manager: That would suggest the double curved design's probably going to be most appropriate , then . Speaker user interface: And  also this is  a rather nicer de design gimmick that the  the you know the whole thing you know  it should have sort of organic feel to it that it should be , you know , soft to touch the the joystick unit should rest over the the joint of the f of the four finger and it would need t there would need to be a  it would need to be articulated just below that so that it could be switched around for left or right handed users . And you then have , at the at the bottom , the L_C_D_ , and this would need to be articulated as well . the t the top function button in basic mode would be the on off switch and menu mode would be the enter button . And then the bottom function buttons switches between between modes . Programming them can be a right pain . So I thought th the simplest way around that would be to have a cable to connect it to the computer some  some fair iv  fairly fairly simple software on the computer just so that you  on your  computer And you could download programs for it from for T_V_s from all sort of main manufacturers .",

Few questions about a spongy remote control . I've never seen one before . if we want something strong and sturdy , I say stay with plastic or titanium , but if we go with spongy , we can stress that you can drop this as many times as you want , I just don't know how the L_E_D_ and the lights are gonna fit into a spongy material If we're gonna use spongy material we have to think of how practical it is , And also , this was this year . things change all the time , every year",

I don't know what cost implications there are in that . , looks like we're pretty much decided on some kind of flexible rubber . Though I'd have to say  depending on how flexible it is , we might need to have some kind of inner frame . Speaker user interface: there would be basically two points of articulation . W one below and one above the m the the main sort of grip . Speaker project manager: Do you think there's any way we could maybe remove the articulation ? but it could be a weak point in the structure , do you think ? Speaker user interface: If you then have a sort of outer skin of flexible , spongy rubber then you have something that is you know very much you know organic , Speaker project manager: if we take some of the ideas  why don't we make the damn thing yellow to incorporate the des the colour of the logo ?

I was gonna talk about the programmable remote control . Now I think it'd be cool if you had one remote control that could work with all T_V_s , you s you click a button and it finds the frequency that works with your particular television . Speaker user interface: e each manufacturer will have a partic  will have a particular command set that the T_V_ responds to . But if we had some sort of hook-up to your computer as an option , then if you've got a computer you can avoid that rather irritating thing . Speaker project manager: An interesting point is that if the person doesn't have the computer , we can still make the process easier because instead of having to look up codes , maybe we can have it that one of the options they have is that they look up the name of the company on the L_C_D_ Speaker user interface: mo most of the sort of layout design decisions are  are made , I would say . but then again , the the menu structure to to a considerable extent that's gonna vary according to the model of television , and also any customisations that the user might wish to incorporate . Speaker project manager: programming it to use your T_V_ , you might hook it up to the P_C_ . The the idea was that maybe it could connect up for allowing a software interface on the P_C_ for a larger programming I'm not sure , but I'm thinking maybe that the additional cost of the U_S_B_ might be prohibitive . I think we've got an idea of where we need to go for the next meeting , Speaker industrial designer:  they're going with the fashion thing , like the design , spongy rubber .

Quite how the best way to do this is , I'm not sure , Speaker user interface:  I think if we both step up and outline our ideas . do  doing the prototype gave us a bit more insight into the ergonomics of the design . for one thing , it turned out that the only point at which it needs to be articulated for handedness is is h i is down here for the L_E_D_ . As it turned out , the whole thing transfers from the right to left hand fairly well from the point of view of operating the function buttons and joystick , You could simply have a slightly ovoid shaped joystick that could then just be turn twisted round , But as you as you see with the  with holding it in the left hand , the L_ the L_C_D_ is nowhere useful , so that would need to be articulated if we're going to retain  ergonomic design .  this design could be done with with plastic casing . Though I would recommend around the grip part here in the middle , having maybe just a rubber grip over that which would allow for a slightly more sort of bio-morphic form , and a bit more ergonomic as well . I I got your note about keeping the cost down . As for the as for the single curve , well this edge and this edge , like I say it would be nice to have some curvature to it , Really the curve that's most needed is the underside and you have the transmitter here and a wee speaker for the for the for the fi for the remote control finder . Speaker industrial designer: obviously it's gonna be bulkier than how it looks , because it's gonna be flat on one side , And it's plastic as well , so it won't be as comfortable on the hand .

Even then as well , there was no criteria technically defined for a joystick so I've used what I think's appropriate . It blows a lot of our really good ideas kind of slightly to one side , for example the possibility of having a U_S_B_ connection is definitely not viable now . . We've got an advanced chip , we've got the use of the L_C_D_ . I really think as m much as it pains me is that we might have to go with plastic and some kind of solid design , possibly meaning that the L_C_D_ wouldn't be in this perfect place . Speaker user interface: Mm-hmm I suppose o one thing that could be done is h  is have it circular Speaker marketing expert: Do you have any data on how much different prints cost ? I mean can you get the entire thing printed with a design ? Speaker project manager: You now have as much information as I do .  . I've said single curved . We really do need it to be that way for the ergonomics of it . plastic for some reason incurs no cost , if I've read this thing correctly , then we can save point five of a Euro here in that it's not per push button . As you can see , the use of an L_C_ display advanced chip and what would determine the scroll wheel here as well I'm very much open to suggestions of where we go , this one comes in under price as you can see , but this was the one that sacrificed the material for the case and for the actual case design . Speaker marketing expert:  what about speakers and transmitters and stuff like that ? Have we factored that in ? Speaker project manager: no , we haven't , not  Speaker marketing expert: Transmitter , receiver , speakers . Plus the extra device itself that's gonna be on a T_V_ . Speaker industrial designer: That's too expensive  Speaker user interface: . I think  if we remove the the L_C_ display then there was absolutely no point to any of these meetings Speaker project manager: If we remove the L_C_ display , we could save ourselves If we could've increased the price we could've manufactured that and we could've got something far closer to what we were hoping to . but for the purposes of this meeting , I'm  we're gonna have to stick with these figures . I would say that it would seem like the general opinion is we're gonna keep the L_C_ display are people maybe not happy with , but are willing to go ahead with this in going for a plastic solid case , to keep the L_C_D_ ? Speaker user interface: I mean ho how much extra would it be to to keep I mean  keep the the articulation ? Speaker project manager: I would say that you're at least gonna take double curved , Speaker industrial designer: it can still be single curved , Speaker marketing expert: Could we could we not get rid of the curvy the curvous the curvaceousness and focus on the menu being the best interface ?

So what the concept is to have a flip-top model . The main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you  you can say like the y young generation or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever , can be put in the middle part of the f flip-top . and we can punch in new f features such as  added features such as shock proof body because there are times like people have used a remote control for say a year or something and they they are not used maybe thirty to forty percent of the buttons so we we can maybe go for an economies of a higher production so we can give in  add in more features and make it less costly . if you ask me personally , I would make flip-top with a trendy design because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after continuous use  usage and all that . and s maybe we we should look at also like the buttons whe whether they are like soft or little hard",

The overall thing which I've I've got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls , , we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . Eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy , but that's quite a high proportion of our our , you know , international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that's a bit nicer looking . , current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user overall . For example , you can see below there , seventy five percent of users zap a lot ,  , fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons , and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we don't have so many functions actually on the remote control . the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were something that you you mentioned earlier , remote controls are often lost in the room , fifty percent were were particularly frustrated by that . thirty four percent of people take  said they take too much time to learn to use , slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for repetitive strain injury . the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like a liquid crystal display and speech recognition , again that was to aid I think in  when they've lost the actual remote control , some kind of speech recognition .

'cause some of the things that we looked at last time aren't  unfortunately aren't available . This is the chip called the T_A_ double one eight three five which is what's used in pretty much every remote control 'cause it sends out standard signals , based on your input and then we we're loo looking into battery options . There's actually no rechargeable option available , I saw the the standard double A_ and triple A_ which we thought were a bit bit too bulky at the moment , dynamo charging , I thought that that might be a bit silly to be to be honest , So you wind up your remote control before you use it . like the the solar charging , 'cause most people have the light on in the room anyway so they could get  when when you got T_V_ . Speaker project manager: I'm pretty sure that solar is from the sun . Speaker industrial designer: But I I think I think the the next one's the best anyway . The the kinetic charging which is like you get it in r you get it in wrist watches I mean the amount the amount of probably moving around you'd be doing all the time would would charge it up , Speaker user interface: it like it runs for long time ? Speaker industrial designer: well I do I d I'm not entirely sure how long it would last but I've never seen one run out  . Speaker marketing expert: referring back to solar charging , is that compatible with standard batteries ? Speaker industrial designer: Ye yeah I think I th g y you could have a dual power thing but the the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case on a calculator they they're qui they're quite big and they all they all look i identical . Yeah the normal batteries would be the cheapest Speaker user interface: W w which one would last the longest , because we don't want customers to be like you know charging like a mobile phone every day . Speaker project manager: 'Cause if we're doing the kinetic thing Speaker marketing expert: Shouldn't we do some market research on that first before we add it in It's not something that's come up in any of our focus groups and market research , But it's something to put on the side to think about maybe . Speaker industrial designer: most current remotes use this silicone P_C_B_ board which  pr printed circuit board , the thing about is they they can be as big or as small as you want them to be Now what I was thinking about that was  'cause sometimes when y when you have these things , they've got little lights on behind the buttons , so you can see what all the buttons are , but you could you could have lights behind the buttons , the case material , I've a been sent what the factory can actually give us , which I think we were gonna go for anyway as the main case  case housing there's the plastic well you could go for wood but I think it would be a bit impractical . Titanium very expensive just to process , so perhaps some something made of rubber , If you go for titanium they can only do a standard box shape , whereas if you come to plastic they can they can be a little more  they can they can do sort of curved shapes . Speaker user interface: yeah and second question is like , a mobile you can change the cover , So in this case if you're looking at like a customer can change the colour like from green , parrot green to chilli red or something like that . Speaker marketing expert: I was just wondering if we make the basic mould out of plastic but have like a rubber cover that goes over , Speaker project manager: So instead of the fascia that comes off being plastic , the fascia that comes off would be the rubber , Well that's been really popular with mobile phones so I don't see why not . Speaker industrial designer: but I thought that an L_C_D_ type of screen  the problem with it basically is that it's flat and so you can't do lots of curve  curved things with it , Speaker marketing expert: I don't see why the curved thing is a problem , if we for example had a shell , once we open that  Speaker industrial designer: You could have a flat screen inside , yeah , w or we could have rubber buttons which are made of this material which is anti-R_S_I_ . Speaker project manager: I think it would be good to have a contrast between , if the whole thing is gonna be this rubber thing it would be good to open it up and see something quite fancy looking inside . Speaker marketing expert:  Is it possible , just as an option , when we open it up , people can use their fingers to press the button , or we have inside like a small pointer thing when people want to  .

This is underneath the rubberised the rubberised outer casing which there'd be sort of a wide choice  the wide choice of colours and sort of patterns ,  it's obviously an a sort of clam-shell design  and  the the top L_C_D_ screen that you can see that would b would be sort of  how do you say , it's  yeah yeah , it would be sort of inset into the into the top Speaker user interface: The black and white touch screen Speaker industrial designer: and the buttons at the bottom would d so so it'll fully close flat . we've already said  d decided on the kinetic batteries , which  actually , thinking about it now , could y could also probably attach to the flipping open and shut as well , Speaker project manager: So put it in the top section rather than the bottom sections , Speaker industrial designer: we decided that the voice recognition system , it did actually say on the email that they were sort of coming in  and they were fairly easy to get a-hold of , so we presumed that they'd also be quite cheap . So you'd have something like where you'd shout out , where where is the remote and it'll shout back , I'm here , or something . the standard , there's  be a standard transmission with the T_V_ using using all the standard chips that we've talked about . obviously 'cause it's split over two two different layers , it would need two separate P_C_B_s , so it would be joined at the hinge through some sort of cabling .  And because , obviously , all T_V_s use this , the same infrared medium , we'd just be using using the same thing to transmit the data . And the infrared sender would be on the  on one of the bot the bottom layer , just at the front of the  So when you've actually got it open , it would be facing the T_V_ . And then finally on to the interface .  The top screen , as we said , is  would be an inset black and white L_C_D_ s touch screen which  yeah would have all of all of the the available functions for for the remote on it , whereas the bot the bottom screen would just contain the standard buttons , like the vo volume up and down , channel up and down , power on and off , and things to that effect .

Speaker marketing expert: This stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate if we have now got a product specification and prototype design that meets the the criteria that we got from our market research . the collection of the criteria , as we saw in our previous meeting , was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of our company . are we actually meeting those trends and requirements ? So it's what we've discussed in the last meeting , The criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy look and feel , technological innovation , it should be easy to use , it should incorporate current fashion trends , and those  the two main ones , they were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colours .  The design should minimise R_S_I_ and be easy to locate and we were still slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there , though that did seem to be the favoured strategy , We're going to use a seven point scale , where one is true and seven is false . and I will just do a preliminary rating of all those criteria on the whiteboard here . Speaker user interface: Is it everybody is going to evaluate , or just the Market  Speaker marketing expert: w we'll discuss each one and we'll come to a consensus rating between one and seven . I won't write all of that out again . It will just be criteria one , two , three , four , five , six , Actually , it might be an idea , if we each did give our own individual rating , and we could take an average at the end . So I'll just separate the ratings by obliques , and if we go one , two , three , four , we know who's who . Criteria A_ , the fancy look and feel . My own rating for that would be a two . Two and three quarters ? criteria B_ , criterion B_ , technologically innovative . I would give that a three . Speaker industrial designer: I'd give it a one . Speaker project manager: It's just two point five for that one . Speaker marketing expert: ease of use . Based on what you've said there , I would say a one , true . Speaker project manager: I would say a two . I would say a two . One point seven f five . Speaker marketing expert: it incorporates current fashion trends , I'm just thinking , before I give it my rating , you were limited in the use of materials for your prototype here . Is this actually going to be the colours that you would use ? Speaker industrial designer: the the base colour was  white or or like or l sort of a light blue , but the changeable fa faces would allow you to get any  basically any one of a number of colours that th it's full sort of customised . Speaker marketing expert: So we could use any strong fruit and veg colours and that's what we're intending to do . Speaker industrial designer: 'cause th that's that's the the spongy feel would be in the rubber that you put round it , Speaker marketing expert: In that case it's got to be a one for me . Speaker industrial designer: Yeah , I'll give it a one as well . Speaker marketing expert: to does the design minimise repetitive strain injury . I don't think we've really touched on that a lot . we haven't really come up with anything that we felt could feasibly reduce that . but the very use of a remote control , if you're someone who's zapping , who's sitting like that , and we found so many people did , how do you minimise that on such a small device ? Speaker project manager: the type of button that we're gonna use in the bottom half , the material , minimises R_S_I_ but with the amount of stuff we're putting on it isn't that much . Speaker marketing expert: I think I'm gonna have to be neutral on that and give it a four . Speaker industrial designer: I'd I'd f I'd go for a five , actually , Speaker marketing expert: And finally , last but not least , easy to locate . Now we talked about voice recognition , we talked about a beeper , have the designers come to any dec real decision on that ? Speaker industrial designer: Yeah , it was it was a voice voice recognition , Speaker marketing expert: And are we happy with the costs on that ? That is going to be feasible , cost-wise . Speaker industrial designer: Yeah , yeah , that  yeah , that's feasible . it would be quite loud . Speaker project manager: And if you didn't hear it in the room that you were standing in , then you'd realise that it wasn't in that room , you'd go into another room . Speaker marketing expert: That's a one for me . Speaker industrial designer:  I do realise that we might be being fairly biased , 'cause it is our product , Speaker marketing expert: We've got our our  we've got the highest rating of meeting the specifications that is definitely true for two of the six criteria there . That is for incorporates current fashion trends and is easy to locate .

Speaker industrial designer: and I was just curious to know , have we done any research into how many people can whistle ? is that a function we want in the remote ? Speaker project manager: you could have the basically instead of a whistle if it's got the voice recognition you could have it just , you know , where are you ?  .  Speaker industrial designer: a much easier thing is just any loud noise like clapping , shouting , you know , and then , what would the response be ? It beeps back at you or something ?",

And a novel feature which we just brought up was this this automatic speech recognition feature or noise detection feature for when you lose the remote , there could be a little microphone on it , and any noise over a certain threshold it'll pick up as a a distress signal from you and it'll beep back and say you know oh here I am or something of this sort . Speaker project manager: But sure surely that would have to be sort of specific rather than above a threshold 'cause if you had a loud movie on you're likely to get it beeping back at you . Speaker industrial designer: and then as for the user interface it should be trendy , right , so more low tech and not too many buttons . So I think I I missed the budget thing , it was fifty million Euros ? Speaker project manager: so we're making that at twelve and a half Euros a time . Speaker industrial designer: Well I guess more realistically then , we need a product that's got some kinda nifty outer casing , An energy source which'd probably just be your regular batteries  cheap plastic , you know , Speaker project manager: Would it be possible to have the rechargeable idea ? Speaker industrial designer: Yeah , yeah , we could do that too . Speaker user interface: Or a little base station or something ,  . Speaker industrial designer: the canonical user interface for these would be just a bunch of buttons , but since we're a cutting edge company , we of course will have alternatives like speech recognition , whistling recognition and rocket power and lastly the transmission interface is , just some engineering thing you don't have to worry about . so here's you know , a great schematic that my apprentice designer gave me . personal preferences , I think programmable options which just require a small amount of memory , just so the user can put in their favourite channels and maybe their preferred volume settings so that when they turn it on it's not blasting . And the , the bells and whistles that we mentioned you know , they take more budgeting , more technical expenditure of effort and it's also much more likely to not work if if we add these bells and whistles .",

Speaker project manager: I think it  th w we're talking the the functional design is more your area of things where you'll be  we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control but the conceptual design is perhaps bigger than that and includes the  how people are going to use it and and that kind of thing .

The last three bullets have been integrated from the last minute email . as I told you the identification of how the remote control works and what are the various parts to it and what are the different processes  and how the parts communicate with each other . also the remote control should be used only for television , because incorporating other features makes it more comp complex . And the reason why teletext is outdated because of internet and the availability of internet over television . also the management wants that our design should be unique so  it should incorporate colour and the slogan that our company has it as its standard .  Okay , so he he here is a functional overview of the remote control . there's basically an energy source at the heart which feeds into the chip and the user interface . The user interf interface communicates with the chip , if if this is our energy source and this is a cell , it communicates  it feeds energy into the into the chip , which basically finds out h how how to do everything . There is a user interface here .  So whe when the user presses a button , it feeds into the chip and the chip then generates a response and takes the response to an infrared terminal , the there can be a bulb here or something to indicate whether the remote is on or communicating . so the output of the chip is an infrared bit code , whatever new functions that we need to do , make the chip more complicated and bigger , basically . i in my personal preferences  I'm hoping that we can ke keep the design as simple and clear as possible . This would help us to upgrade our technology at a future point of time . And also if we can incorporate the latest features in our chip design , so that our  remote control does not become outdated soon and it's compatible with mot most televisions . Speaker project manager: Do you have any i idea about costs at this point ? Speaker industrial designer:  No , I don't have any idea about what each component costs .

And and also the volume is very important . among the findings I found that m m most of the curr presently available remote controls also include other  functionalities in their design , like operating a V_C_R_ , but they don't seem to be able to deal with D_V_D_ players , but according to the last minute update actually we do not want to have all this complicated functions added to our design . So my personal preferences would be to keep the the whole remote control small just like the physical size . And then it must be easy to use , so it must follow some conventions like whereabouts you find the on off button and maybe the colour tends to be red or something . But then other functionalities  could be just  there could be a menu button and you could change things on the screen then , for example brightness and similar functions could be just  done through the menu . the last question I had about whether we wanted to incorporate n more functionalities , the answer was already no because of the last minute update . Speaker project manager: but if we had a a decent case for  that we really think it's important to include video and D_V_D_ , I could get back to them and see . Speaker user interface: and also it's it's  other question is because there are so many different  And there are so many different things that could possibly be included because besides video and D_V_D_ there are the video C_D_s and whatever , so it might be problematic to to choose between all these possible things .",

What they found is that people don't like how current remote controls are , seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . eighty percent of users would spend more to get you know , a nice looking remote control . current remote controls , they don't match the user behaviour well , I dunno what zapping is , Speaker project manager: It's switching between channels , sort of randomly going through . Speaker marketing expert: But you have that little thing that comes up at the bottom and tells you what's on . okay , fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons , so that's going back to what , you know , we were saying earlier about , you know , do you need all the buttons on the remote control , they just make it look ugly . so this is my little graph thing . what it shows is how much things are used relatively and what you can clearly see from that is the thing that's used most is the channel selection . What you can't see is volume selection , it's a little bit higher than all the others . so what the graph shows is that , you know , power , channel selection and volume selection are important , and the rest of them , you know , nobody really uses and so that's the the numbers along the top represent their like their importance , you know , and , you know , channel selection and volume selection are absolutely essential , and the power , well it's not quite so essential , apparently ,  and everything else , I think , you know , you can forget about having those buttons on the remote control , so this is what people find annoying about remote controls . that they get lost , that the you know , they're not intuitive and that they're bad for repetitive strain injury . you want something with an ergonomic t design that encourages good use of the remote control but that shows how people  whether they would pay more for voice recognition software . So you can see from that that , you know , younger people to the age of thirty five are quite likely to pay quite a lot more f well quite  are quite likely to pay more for voice recognition software , whereas as people get older , they're a bit more sceptical about it so clearly voice recognition is something to think about , but you know I d I do wonder how well that would work given that a T_V_ , you know , tends to be people talking and , you know , how are you going to stop it from just flipping channels whilst watching T_V_ . so these are my personal preferences .

So if we need to have a target group then  I think as far as the m motto of our company is concerned , if we want to have something sleek and you know , good looking we are better off targeting a younger audience then you know , people who are comparatively elderly . Speaker marketing expert: I mean that's the thing is that it didn't say in the survey , you know , whether , you know , these are the people that will pay more for a more stylish remote control , Speaker industrial designer: Bu but but the survey did say that f things like voice recognition are more popular with them , Speaker project manager: Then again I guess the th where it was most popular was the fifteen to twenty five bracket and the  I don't know how often they're buying televisions . I would've thought it's it's more that twenty five to thirty five , when people are really moving out and they've got their first job and they want their nice toys and  Speaker industrial designer: wh people between twenty five to thirty five , how popular was  Speaker marketing expert: Seventy six point three percent . but I mean it has been proven that that people of that age group have a higher disposable income I mean like it is an age group to target , really , I think .

Speaker industrial designer: but voice recognition itself I'm not very sure about , Speaker project manager: With  but with a T_V_ remote it's gonna be quite limited if we're t saying the main things people want to do is on off channel five , tha that should be relatively simple . Speaker marketing expert: y you'd maybe need a code word . but like so you'd just say remote five , you know , remote ten , remote one two nine . Speaker project manager: but maybe if you wanna look into that just to just to check . Speaker user interface: w well now the v the voice recognition if if it works wonderfully w we could possibly do away with all buttons , but I think this is not really the right moment yet , because people are just so used to buttons Speaker industrial designer: What wh  what I was thinking is that there is this separation between what the channels are on T_V_ and how they are numbered on the remote control . If we can do with  away with that , our product can be really popular in the sense that a person can say , I want to watch I_T_V_ one instead of saying that I want to go onto channel number forty five . Speaker project manager: So that if that was in the the voice recognition , that would be great . Speaker marketing expert: It's more like if you lost it and it's down the sofa sometime , you can yell at it  and it'll just change it , you can look for it later , yeah . Speaker user interface: Yeah but m but on the other hand , remote control isn't  as close to you you probably might just just speak into it Speaker industrial designer: yeah and it might become very difficult from a distance for the television to understand what you're saying because of the noise factor for the remote control Speaker user interface: No , but I I I was just defending the  the fact why why we want to keep the remote control close to us , a and not to yell at it from the distance . Speaker industrial designer: So  wh another thing that can be used is that there can be a beeper button on the T_V_ , so you can go and press that button and and the remote control , wherever it is , it'll beep , so we we can probably come to know where it is . Speaker project manager: But if we go away with that that kind of general  specification in mind that we're looking at fifteen to thirty five year olds , we want it to look simple , but still have the buttons so it's easy to use , but only those key buttons , the major buttons and then one sort of menu one , and then voice recognition included as an option but that obviously needs a little bit more working out as to whether it's really feasible and some of those problems we were mentioning .

So I thought I would also include the definition of user interface so it's the aspects of a of of a computer system or programme which can be seen by the user the mechanisms that the user uses to control its operation and input data . So this would p includes things like shape and size and buttons and voice recognition as well , and colour , and so on . the method I  employed this time was  a again having a look to related products and mainly on the internet and then   analyse them from the point of view of user fen friendliness and  also  whether their appearance was was pleasant . this can help us to decide which features we want to incorporate in our product . So in in the case of many user interfaces , they're just so full of buttons that it's actually hard to find the ones you you really want to use and and it's just confusing , it takes y know time to learn . and I thought I would just quickly show some of them that I found . so yeah , they're quite big and have many many buttons . Actually  of the  of all these I personally p prefer this one , because it's it's the smallest and and with with least  with the smallest number of buttons as well . And I would say even the appearance of some of them is kind of not so nice .",

Our own company has developed a new in user interface we can include voice recognition i it's possible to record eighty different voice samples on it . s another new development is a scroll button , so this this one was already mentioned the L_C_ display . And our own manufacturing division ha has designed  a new   programmable speech  it it it comes together with a voice recognition , So  I mean this is also one of the n dev new developments which we might consider if we wanted to include . but it's  once once the  gadget recognises the voice of the speaker , there can be a pre-programmed answer , Speaker industrial designer:  are you sure wha what this means , a spinning wheel with the L_C_ display ? Speaker user interface: the scroll button is a different thing . I I have a picture if you   just a moment , Speaker industrial designer:  Oh okay , the iPod thing , yeah . Speaker user interface: but I think it's just like  it's it's a wheel , it's like not separate buttons . Speaker marketing expert: It's like it's like where you  you know how you have your your mouse , and y you go round and i it's kind of like that and you spin round I like the the wheels that click on the side you you get 'em much slower , Do you know , if you're lookin if you're th scrolling through the A_ to Z_ of your music and you're looking for something at T_ , then it's a lot faster than the wheel , but you've got a lot less control over it . Speaker user interface: Okay , and the personal preferences are pretty much the same as as as last time . Okay , we decided to include voice recognition , so to have the standard major buttons like on , off , ch the channels and and then volume and then the rest would be a menu on the screen . and I I also thought  if we want to keep it small and nice and actually I I quite like the idea of a scroll a scrolling button , I thought it could be for for voice like , I dunno , it like on a i like it used to be on Walkmans or something .",

Now , the first aspect is apparently twice as important as the second aspect , which is twice as important as the third a aspect . So , I mean the the easy to use thing is fairly low down on the  which I think given the target group is what you would expect , really . , you know , people want something new , something technologically innovative and different , so the whole idea with the L_C_D_s and the spinning and the colours and the voice recognition is quite like , quite the thing to go for . Speaker industrial designer: So  maybe as you're discussing things , is it okay if we just keep highlighting things here ? so probably voice recognition is is kind of important , right ? Speaker project manager: And maybe the L_C_D_ and spinning  Speaker industrial designer: Okay , I I have a point about L_C_D_ , W L_C_D_s are basically for feedback , right , to the user who's pressing buttons , and the feedback can come through television itself , so do we need an L_C_D_ on the remote ? Speaker marketing expert:  Depends how fast your television runs , really , I mean we've got one of those Telewest boxes and you put the number in the remote so i it actually takes quite a long time . so I think , you know , a screen on the remote would probably cut down your time on that . Speaker project manager: It it is also quite nice though to to have something here so you don't interrupt the picture on the screen , Speaker marketing expert: But I think maybe a way to do it would be a similar way to how you have your mobile phone , you know , like you have the slidey ones and you have the flippy ones So you can have like what looks like a normal remote control , you know or like a minimalist remote control . So you got your buttons one to nine , your on and off and your volume on that and then if you want to mess about with it , you flip it open and ,",

Speaker project manager: it's not  that's not streamlined and sexy ,  having a having a wind up . Speaker industrial designer: kinetic energy does seem to have some kind of appeal , Speaker marketing expert:  It's about the practicality of it really , isn't it ? You know ? Speaker industrial designer: this this thing will have to be tapped every time , which which might be very frustrating for the user . Speaker project manager:  Depends how much how much movement it really needs . Speaker industrial designer: Okay , let's keep it option keep an option , Wood , do you think wood will be a good idea ? Speaker marketing expert: I can't imagine a m wooden remote control . Speaker project manager: and given that we're we're looking at more spongy material preferences , I ha would think maybe rubber or plastic is more  Speaker marketing expert: I mean it's it's alright for a table , And splinters and stuff and  You have to have some push-buttons , don't you ? Speaker user interface: I think for for the channel numb channel numbers you still need them , wouldn't you ? Speaker industrial designer: if you have an L_C_D_ display , then you can select almost everything on the L_C_D_ display . Speaker user interface: when we s  discussed that we might like this flipping open thing , then I mean y you can use it as a normal remote control , Speaker marketing expert: I think this is going back to the the graph at the beginning that I made , where , you know , the buttons that people use all the time , you want buttons for them and everything else menu-driven . I think the thing is , so if someone just wants to turn on their T_V_ and put on a channel , then it should be easier to use than any other remote , and then if someone wants to , you know , change the contrast on their T_V_ and  they should be able to do that and it should be accessible , Speaker user interface: So I think it  it doesn't make sense to have both like a scrolling and spinning thing , Speaker project manager: Just spinning and not scrolling , I would say . Speaker marketing expert: But I mean the the thing with this whole  if y you're planning on making it out of rubber , on the basis that it's spongy , then I'm not sure how well a scrolling wheel would work . Speaker project manager: But if you've got a  if if you've got a flipped thing , effectively it's something that's curved on one side and flat on the other side , but you folded it in half . Speaker industrial designer: I'm not sure it'll be a good idea to construct the whole thing out of rubber . Speaker user interface: the case would be rubber and the the buttons , Speaker project manager: No , I think it's just the casing rubber on the outside . Speaker industrial designer: Everything else in plastic or even titanium if we want to use it . Speaker marketing expert: Or maybe like interchangeable cases . but I have like a   you know , obviously my iPod's not made of rubber , but then I have a little rubber case that goes over the top of it and I can change the colour , theoretically , to match my outfit . I think the spinning wheel is definitely very now . Speaker industrial designer:  And colours can be provided with the case rather than  Speaker user interface: it was a a requirement that we use our th the colours of our company , so would it be like yellow , grey and black or something , or  Speaker marketing expert: That doesn't fit in with the whole vegetable theme though . Speaker project manager: Bananas .  Speaker marketing expert: but I mean do you think we could incorporate the colours of the company into the buttons and then make the colour of the main remote  the colour like vegetable colours , do you know ? I mean I suppose vegetable colours would be orange and green and some reds and maybe purple and that and then you'd pick the buttons in company colours to to match with it . Speaker industrial designer: since we're having L_C_D_s there there's no way that we're will be able to  what we do need to consider , however , is that the price is going up for the ever every such thing that we are considering , but since L_C_D_s seems to be a definite yes , So I'll rub off the other two . Speaker marketing expert: So are we discounting solar energy because rubber's gonna be used in there somewhere or  Speaker industrial designer: a although it does seem interesting . okay , so r we understand this better now that the the speaker is for the feedback , right ? Speaker project manager: I think if we can if we can include them at not too much extra cost , then I'd put them in , And the case is curved on one side , but then flat flat , so it's flipped into each other . Speaker industrial designer: Flat on the top . we we're definitely going in for voice recognition as well as L_C_D_s , . Speaker project manager: So we've basically worked out that we're going with a simple battery , the advanced chip Speaker industrial designer: using the simple battery will be a safer option as compared to the kinetic energy one , I mean , Speaker project manager:  We need the advanced  yeah . and a curved on one side case which is folded in on itself , made out of rubber and the buttons are also rubber . Speaker marketing expert: You've maybe got , you know   like if you're modelling on iPod you've got five buttons and a wheel , and four of the buttons are in the wheel , and the other one's the little bit inside the wheel , Speaker project manager: Okay , so now we've got thirty minutes before our next meeting . In the meantime , the Industrial Designer over here is gonna work on the look and feel design , the User Interface Designer will work on the user interface design and the Marketing Expert is going to work on product evaluation .

They had a hundred subjects and their usability lab and recorded the frequency that they used particular buttons and the relevance that those buttons had . Focusing on their desires , people specifically said that they thought remotes were ugly  , seventy five per cent of the a hundred subjects noted that more importantly though , eighty per cent said that they would be willing to pay more for a fancier looking remote . and found that the desire for voice recognition was inversely related to age , so younger people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition , That being people k frustrated with losing their remotes . I think , over fifty percent of the people mentioned that that was their biggest frustration . People are also frustrated with the difficulty it is to learn how to use a remote and I think that ties back to what you were saying before just that there's too many buttons , It also mentioned something called R_S_I_ and I was hoping someone might be able to inform me as to what R_S_I_ is , Speaker user interface: Repetitive strain injury . Speaker marketing expert: So I guess sort of the carpal tunnel type thing , people do not like that , looking at the needs people specified , the problem right now is that people's remotes are not matching their operating behaviour . People are only using ten per cent of the buttons that they have offered to them on their remote . People also zap like to change the channel , about sixty five per cent during an hour of use . So we really just need to focus in on those volumes and channel changers rather than things like the audio settings , the screen settings and the channel settings , the idea of an L_C_D_ screen was brought up although they didn't have any details on what people's preferences on that were , also just the phenomenon that less is more when it comes to the buttons on the remote make sure that , you know , something like an audio setting isn't given as much importance and visibility on the remote as something like channel changing that's used a lot more often .

It's a device that allows us to produce certain effects on our television , it sends a message to the television First thing to do is to come up with the design specifications . so we need a a clear idea of exactly what this product does , and what the end-user is gonna want from this product . a way I'd suggest that we could go about this is by designing several different prototypes of user interfaces for this product , and then trying to get some feedback about h how well these particular prototypes work , When a users using a remote control , he or she expects the buttons to be in certain places . So in some sense we're gonna we're gonna have to aim for a device which is fairly conventional in design But I think within that there is also room for us to introduce novel ideas also in in designing the user interface we need to consider practicalities . the first of these is is technological we need to find a balance between features and price . things like voice recognition would would add to the price but it would also im improve the design of the product . personally wa what I want from a remote control is a device that's simple , it's got big buttons for doing the things I do most often , changing the volume , changing the channel . that's ergonomically designed .

So you make a schematic of the way that the the energy is converted tsh towards this practical function . the findings that I got very  just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that the information is projected to the receiver and in my opinion infra-red is the best way to do that the user interface is critical here , because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip that controls  that converts the electrical energy into data , the components that we find here are the energy source , you know the battery or whatever that's gonna m make it work , then the chip , which converts the data , the user that's controlling the chip , and the infra-red bulb that's gonna let us move the data to the receiver . And  personal preferences , besides the fact that I can't spell , we need a long-lasting energy source , We need a chip that works well with the user interface , and we need a reliable and clear infra-red signal ,",

We have a couple new requirements but we're not gonna work with teletext We didn't bring it up yet , or at all in the meetings so far , Speaker marketing expert: What's teletext ? Speaker industrial designer: , it's a British thing . Speaker user interface: I suppose it's kind of similar to a very very basic web browser . this this kind of index appears on the television screen with just some some text and some very blocky looking graphics on it . and it gives you information , mostly rather boring stuff like what's on T_V_ next and share prices and that kind of thing . It's earl it's pretty old technology . Speaker project manager: like your question earlier whether this is going to be t for television , video , or etcetera . Just for television . That's what we're focused on . otherwise becomes to complex , and finally there's more marketing , I think , , our corporate image has to be recognisable . while we're gonna make it look pretty we need to use our colour and our slogan i in the new design . Speaker user interface: It's  It's kind of yellow colour with we put fashion in electronics . Speaker project manager: and we have that  the emphasis on the R_s in  Looks like , yeah , kind of a yellow and black Speaker user interface: It's like double R_ . Speaker project manager: we need to talk about our functions and our target group . You in your analysis of different market  of the marketing , you identified that different groups wanted different things Speaker industrial designer: if we're gonna say that function fashion  we put the fashion in in electronics then you  automatically , I think , a sort of younger group that  that's  who's gonna be attracted to this . Speaker marketing expert: I do think , who's gonna have the money to buy that also , that one ? Speaker project manager: at least right now what we're doing is deciding on just the remote itself , Speaker marketing expert: The only break-down that I was given in terms of age was the voice activation so it's like basically fifteen to thirty five that think that that's a good idea . Speaker industrial designer: that's probably a population w quite a little bit of disposable income for use on technology anyway , Speaker project manager: that's all specific for speech recognition . Are we gonna use that as one of our functions ? Speaker user interface: I I would say no , because it's gonna add too much to the price . And I wonder if we can get voice recognition into that twelve and a half Euros without having to make too many other compromises . Speaker industrial designer: but why are we why are we aiming for a technological advancement ? Everything we're talking about is ease of use and simple Speaker marketing expert: If someone's looking to buy a new remote , don't they want like an upgrade ? Speaker project manager: or we can look at user-friendly . And we also need to talk about if we're only gonna have the very simple ones or also have the other ones just separate somehow Speaker marketing expert: like if it was just a simple , either this way or this way , that had like the main buttons and then you could like pull something out , 'Cause then 's like people who don't wanna ever look at them , never even have to see them Speaker project manager: what are we emphasising ? I  what in this project ? which includes an emphasis on making the infra-red very functional , Speaker user interface: Si simplicity and fashion . Speaker marketing expert: What can you do to like make the infra-red more functional , Speaker project manager: I think it's a lot  to do with battery , Speaker marketing expert: So 's just the quality of the chip . Speaker project manager: So our target group , we're saying , fifteen to thirty five ? Speaker marketing expert: I dunno how useful that number is if we're not doing  Speaker project manager: S voice recognition , Speaker marketing expert: And if the whole idea is you're using a remote then why would you have voice , like you know what I mean and then it's like you wouldn't need a remote Speaker user interface: It's for , like , the ultimately lazy people , Speaker marketing expert: I mean if I get m more numbers , I'll e-mail you before the next meeting in terms of ages . Speaker industrial designer: but I th I think regardless we're we're aiming for the under sixty five or something . Speaker project manager: can we narrow it down to maybe teenagers and families ? It's it's hard to narrow it down . Speaker user interface: I think the product appeals across a quite a broad range of ages . so it's going to appeal to people , maybe people who have problems with technology , you know , people who get scared by having lots of buttons , Speaker marketing expert: maybe we don't have to defi define the target group by the demographic of age , Speaker project manager: So maybe it's more useful to d d to define objectives like fashion and simplicity than to find specific target group as far as age is  do we want some kind of thing to find it if it's lost ? Like a button on a T_V_ you can press Speaker marketing expert: It would be relevant to like the overall goal I think , Speaker project manager: so we want something to keep it from getting lost . And  we want we want large buttons for the essential things . We want a possibility to to get a possibility to get the extra functions . Speaker user interface: Which are kind of hidden away in some way Speaker project manager: Battery ? Do we need a long-life battery ?

I haven't seen any pictures of what this exactly looks like yet , and we can make our case out of plastic , the m the main base will be plastic , but we have all these sort of fashion and technological elements we can add in , wood , latex , titanium , rubber or other coloured types of plastic . for buttons we have pushbuttons , but we also have scror scroll wheels , which can have integrated pushbuttons , and have an L_ L_C_D_ screen . or we could go all high-tech  circuit board and chip we can have a simple one , a regular one or an advanced one , And then battery I think is where things get most exciting . we can we can have your sort of basic double A_ batteries , but we also have these options of  using a kinetic battery , so simple movements like pushing buttons would recharge the battery .

Speaker industrial designer: and you press the centre button , that's that's your all-purpose select button right there . Speaker marketing expert: I think why it would be good for us is 'cause like you could have the same wheel sort of effect for like channel flipping and then the other one could be like for volume . Speaker industrial designer: I think an  L_C_D_ screen might be good in theory , but not as useful in practice . Speaker project manager: I've one more slide before we close , but in that slide is when we need to make decisions about this  these kinds of things , and then like the the covers could be spongy latex components concept . Energy , chip on print . can you just explain what that is real quick ? Speaker industrial designer: what do people think about this kinetic battery idea ? Speaker project manager:  I think it's awesome . I think it's really cool . Speaker user interface: as as long as we consider the the cost and the how reliable it is , Speaker industrial designer: I got a whole bunch of information on how circuit boards are produced . which is chip on print is where the machine prints on the wires and solders it all together for us . Speaker user interface: Al all circuit boards are pretty much the same , I think . Speaker industrial designer: I don't really know what to tell you as far as decisions . Speaker project manager: I guess maybe if we decided on like a simple , a regular , or an advanced chip , maybe . Speaker industrial designer: if we're gonna have pushbuttons , they require a simple chip , but a scroll wheel requires a regular chip , Do we want a scroll wheel , Speaker user interface: I don't think we ne really need the scroll whe wheel . Speaker project manager: It would be nice for changing the volume , but I don't know how useful it'd be for changing the channel . Speaker user interface: you really need buttons for changing a channel . Speaker marketing expert: and the volume would just be like the same way , forward and backward as  I'm just thinking like it would make it much like sleeker sort of looking . Speaker industrial designer: When you get on the on-screen menu of all your functions that your remote could do for you without the buttons and you could have a scroll wheel to go through those menus . Speaker user interface: I think  yeah , I think a scroll wheel would be nice , but it's not necessary .  Speaker industrial designer: I'm kinda liking the idea of latex , if if spongy is the in thing . Speaker marketing expert: could it be hard , and then something around it ? Speaker project manager: I would be more okay with like a titanium actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone kind of thing . Speaker industrial designer: what I've seen , just not related to this , but of latex cases before , is that  there's like a hard plastic inside , and it's just covered with the latex . Speaker project manager: and probably in colours , maybe fruity , vegetable colours . Speaker industrial designer: and we want a curved case , Or a double-curved ? Speaker user interface:  And I think if we wanna keep our costs down , we should just go for pushbuttons , Speaker project manager: For channel surfing I think a scroll  an actual  like an iPod's kind of scroll thing would be too fast , Speaker industrial designer: I think it might be better to put our money into the stuff like the kinetic battery and the cool case Speaker marketing expert: I mean I'm not like hard-sold on the scroll wheel , it's more just to give it a different kind of look , Speaker project manager: we're doing an on-screen menu that we can scroll through . So we're gonna have like a menu button , and then supplements , we're gonna go with type pushbuttons , Speaker user interface: volume , favourite channels , and menu . Speaker project manager: Pre-set channels Speaker user interface: I think maybe numbers seems  is kind of old-fashioned . Speaker project manager: Let's go with a simple chip ? did we decide on a chip ? Speaker marketing expert: but if it's gonna be in a latex type thing and that's gonna look cool , then that's probably gonna have a bigger impact than the scroll wheel .",

Speaker industrial designer: we made three different prototypes our colours not  are not fixed , we have the on off button at the tip , very visible , very big . We have our up and down buttons , which are also gonna be our channel selectors , and we have our little menu button here . If you push  if you're just pushing these normally , they're the menu buttons , if  the volume buttons rather . If you press select once , they become channel changing buttons . That's our number one prototype . Speaker project manager: The little lightning bolt in it , very cute . Speaker user interface: We call that one the rhombus , this one is known as the potato , It's an ergonomic shape , I've gone here just for just for four buttons on this one . the two blue buttons here are for adjusting the volume . So you've got volume up and volume down on the other side here . this middle button here brings up the on-screen menu Speaker marketing expert: Could the middle button of the on-screen menu function as a power button ? Speaker user interface: it would make it hard to turn the machine off , to turn your T_V_ off . Speaker industrial designer: And then finally we have the Martian or the pear , either way . it's a bit different , just a little bit more of a creative feel . you have the on off toggle stem on the top .  And then you have on the sides to make it a little bit more three-dimensional , plus it's an interesting talking point to have standing up . We figured it could stand up like this on your table , if you wanted it to , if I made the bot the bottom flat .  Speaker user interface: in terms of making decisions , what we'd need to do is first of all decide on a form which of the three different shapes we want , then decide what kind of button layout we want , how many buttons , and then to choose what colours we want to make the buttons Speaker industrial designer: normally we'd go for fruity colours , but maybe we're also thinking that your sort of middle aged man , for an example customer , might not want a fruity coloured remote , Speaker marketing expert: I sort of like this one , it just it's like small but still sort of like cute looking , But I dunno how much any of this has to do with the fashionable , sort of cool looking thing Speaker project manager: Could we maybe have like an extra button on the top for on off ?",

Speaker project manager: It's kind of like like a joystick kind of thing , Speaker user interface: It makes look more fruity as well . Speaker project manager: There it could have a stem like that , Speaker industrial designer: is that where people are leaning then , the potato ? Speaker project manager: Variety of colours are nice . I think I'm leaning towards the potato . Speaker industrial designer: that's really gotten the simplicity of the buttons down , that one . Speaker user interface: Potato . Speaker marketing expert: some of the things that we've talked about before we need to make sure that that remote actually does conform to the things that we said it was going to . what we sort of wanna do is that we each need to separately rank each of the following things and then I'll tabulate an average and each of you can tell me on a scale of one to seven with one being really extremely true and seven being not true at all , or false , First we wanna know if it meets the fancy look and feel objective . in my opinion the   for now at least , the yellow one is probably somewhere in the middle so I'm gonna say it's like a three .

Speaker industrial designer: it was inspired by the potato , so I think it's pretty fruity . Speaker project manager: I think i it's kind of mangoey too . Speaker industrial designer: That's a much more trendy than a potato  Speaker marketing expert: , and does the design match the appropriate behaviour ? Remember earlier we discussed that people don't use a lot of buttons , so I'm gonna give it a one . also we talked earlier about R_S_I_ and wanting to prevent any sort of like Carpal Tunnely kind of thing .

A user interface controls the chip , basically that's the casing and the buttons and accordingly the messages as well . and I found that too much metal in remote design could potentially cause interference with the ability of the remote to send commands . And too much metal can cause remotes to behave unexpectedly by receiving false signals . too much metal is used sometimes and there's also the possibility of the remote catching on fire just think of those lawsuits , that'd be really bad . Therefore I suggest primarily plastic construction . , components . Just some ideas that I had , , energy source , it's kinda hip to be eco friendly so I thought maybe we could do something with solar power with an alkaline battery backup . the user interface , since we can't use metal I was thinking maybe a high grade recycled plastic . The chip , , silicon based chip I don't really see any way around that , , the sender well I'm thinking infrared 'cause it is the industry standard , PAL and N_T_S_C_ compatible and probably a two hundred foot range . personal preferences , I really think that we should use plastic as opposed to metal , which adm admittedly is gonna come at the cost of a certain aesthetic value , Speaker project manager:  Is is there a way that we can use modern types of polymers , or mo modern types of plastics that maybe do have some kind of aesthetic value on the lapt on these laptops and other ones they use a a pretty nice , Speaker industrial designer: Yeah that shouldn't be a problem .",

Another remote control , slightly different , it's a simpler remote control many less buttons but has many fewer functions , m much easier for the user to manipulate and use . it also has a bit of a cheap look and it's also quite boring . my personal preferences .

And we also found out that fifty percent of our people , their  the worst thing about a remote is how often they lose it . And then they can't find it in the room . So I think what we were talking about with a pager or something , will really come into play with a lot of these people .  there's also a survey about what they liked about remotes , and pretty much they all think they're hideous and not very useful , and the younger demographics are all really interested in voice recognition options . I don't know if that's something we're ready to look into technically , but it is s something worth thinking about , especially since the younger demographic's obviously the one that's gonna keep growing , but basically it really is the primary functions and getting it to look nice , which are",

        "text": "Speaker project manager: I think we've covered most of these important questions through this  through you guys's presentations  we've got y the Industrial Designer suggests or pretty much emphatically suggested that we need to go with plastic .  Sarah , she's recommended that we go for simpler functions , so fewer functions but we need to decide who are we selling this to , you s your stats suggested that seventy five percent of people under thirty five wanted , thought about voice control ,  so do we wanna go for that , or do we want to go for an older demographic , if we're gonna go for a sleek look I mean we are putting the fashion in electronics  .  Speaker marketing expert:  We're not catering to the pensioners of the world I don't think so . Speaker project manager: So maybe this  we should look into this younger demographic .  we need to wonder ah h about how we make it better and smaller and faster think we're constrained to plastics we've got this idea , Ron was saying we need to think about revolutionising the way it's looking , this voice operation thing is  I think is a good idea assuming that it's doable , at least for the basic controls , you can't say record alias tonight at seven P_M_ but we might be able to say  volume up . Speaker industrial designer: I think it would be possible to combine the locator device and the voice recognition technology . With a simple command like locate . And then it could start to beep Speaker project manager: The difficulty wh would be in I think like i you couldn't speak into the remote that you're trying to find . but then again you have this wee  this wee thing you know that's just a little chip or whatever that has the page button , maybe that could be voice activated too . Speaker user interface: A little sticky pad to stick on top of your television . Speaker project manager: but  yeah I like that , I like that , the voice recognition for the paging system . Speaker user interface:  The other thing is we might be able to handle the simplicity of a remote control and kind of put the more complicated things into a voice control . So it could be sold to both the younger market and the older market . and might consider the older market could use the simpler design with the traditional buttons and what not . Speaker marketing expert: Are we still thinking about this screen  if we're gonna do this touch pad screen thing , it would be still , do we know if that's an option technically right now to that ? Speaker user interface: I've looked into costs of touch screen methods and what not , they seem to be you know almost as cheap as a button method at this point . Speaker marketing expert: especially because then you could have like your primary screen just be these you know four or five basic functions , Speaker user interface: 'S definitely an option technically . Speaker marketing expert: menu options or something to have all these other complicated voice recognition , settings , things Speaker industrial designer: Gotta wonder though , if we're adding so much technology to this one remote , are we still gonna be able to meet out twelve pou our twelve fifty Euro you know goal for selling these things . It seems like , we're not gonna be able to handle all these functions with just one microchip . Speaker project manager: I guess we'll cross that bridge in a la slightly later stages of development I'm seeing that we're gonna just basically focus on this young demographic group , aim it at them , but basically we'll make a sleek simple functioned remote control . I think this voice recognition thing is a we've got a market for it I guess we've c we've touched on most of this . The idea of a paging function , a touch screen , and face plates . . we'd have to maybe sacrifice the face plates for a touch screen ? Speaker user interface: I think if you kind of take the example of a mobile phone that trying to pass a portion of the device is not interchangeable whereas the surrounding portions are interchangeable . We could have the casing , the the face plates . Speaker industrial designer:  We have to ask whether we're going to include a certain number of face plates with the package ? Off the top of my head it sounds kind of like a gimmick that wouldn't really go anywhere . Speaker marketing expert: in the publicity of a face plate on a phone is you have it out and around , whereas you're just sit at home , Speaker project manager: we can  we can discuss that one further when we think about whether th when we do costs and so forth , . but yeah we will have to evaluate what's most important . Speaker user interface: have we confirmed that we're gonna go ahead with a touch screen  Speaker project manager: Yeah I think that would be best . based on what sh on what you guys have all said to me let's go for a plastic built or b plastic cased try to look for some kind of high quality recycled plastic With a touch screen for the basic functions .   let's provisionally  let's go for a touch screen one with several submenus for possible extra stuff basically put the channel and the on and off switch on the touch screen . it occurs to me that if we have a touch screen people are going to have to recharge their remote controls .  Yet at the same time that might help for this whole complaint of it being lost . Speaker marketing expert: 'Cause it would have a docking base ? Speaker project manager: But then again that costs as well . Speaker user interface: these new lithium batteries they last twenty years  even with the touch screen ? Speaker project manager: I can't see anybody buying a lap a remote control that they have to plug in if not we can always default to just doing a a well presented plastic simple  it's th with this voice recognition option as well just as for the simple functions the the on off , channels , volume , Even if you can't do voice recognition for the paging you know just some kind of simple button that's just a I guess another infrared signal to the remote control to emit some kind of paging . Just a beep . Speaker industrial designer: Since we're doing touch screen , do we wanna look into the possibility of people being able to input different types of skins for the you know the actual interface part of it and things like that ? Or is it just gonna be one touch screen for everybody . What what would be on that touch screen ? 'Cause you said earlier that we have to think about company colours and logo or something or motto , Speaker project manager: it's my understanding that if you were going to do a skin you'd need to have some way for people to download or import skins into the remote control . Speaker industrial designer: Think we just need to come up with a nice black and red interface on the touch screen . Speaker marketing expert: it'll have your your carrier provider name come up first like while it's loading Speaker user interface: I'm wondering how we're gonna get we put fashion into electronics onto this device . Speaker marketing expert: Comes on every time you turn it on and then that's it 'cause it is a bit much to have it like engraved on the back or something I think . Speaker project manager: it seems like it would suffice to have just the R_R_ on there . Speaker industrial designer: People aren't gonna want their remote to boot up and to see flashing things come on . They just want it to be on and ready to go . Speaker project manager: But then again who wants to turn on a remote control . Speaker user interface: all you have to do is touch the screen and it automatically goes on .

We've already kind of gone over this but we're gonna have to get into more detail Energy source , , our manufacturer offers a variety of energy sources , your standard battery , solar cells . Our manufacturer didn't say anything about lithium if we do go that route , we might have to look elsewhere . , and also there's a kinetic energy possibility . Basically , it's like a  the idea of moving the remote would create enough energy to keep it running . but I don't know whether that would be powerful enough to illuminate a touch screen . , the case , we have a few options , plastic , rubber or wood . and then as far as the way it's shaped , we can do standard boring flat , which we probably don't wanna do , curved or very sexy double curved . Speaker project manager: What kind of th thickness are we looking at ? Speaker industrial designer: , I imagine that we could specify . , the buttons , there are multiple scroll buttons available from our manufacturer , but to use those we'd have to use more chips , And if we do go with the rubber doubled curved case we'll have to use rubber push buttons because the other buttons aren't compatible with that . touch screen equals many chips which equals many Euro . , one thing that I noticed was that most remotes operate on a infrare on the infrared part of the spectrum . So you notice when you push a button on a remote you can't see anything coming out of it but in fact there is light coming out of the remote one thing that I thought might be interesting was to use part  use visible light coming out of the remote , just kind of as a fun gimmick . So you could actually see something coming out of the remote when you pushed it . Speaker project manager: is there an option that we can have that off or on so a person can select like  Speaker industrial designer: I am sure that we could do that . just as a fun gimmick . , and then on to the circuit board that we're gonna use , also known as the chip . , we really don't have any way around the T_A_ one one eight three five . we're very limited by what our current manufacturers can offer , and my question to all of you is , should we look to other manufacturies or should we just make do with what we have available ? Speaker marketing expert: I'd say shop around but with our time constraints , is that really a feasible option ? Speaker industrial designer: , if we do go the lithium battery route then we'll have to go outside our current manufacturer . My personal preference is  I think we should probably go the solar battery route , just to kinda keep with the environmentally friendly theme that we have going on . , I like the idea of the visible light signalling , and I was thinking about  I was thinking of ways that we could produce the remote in a variety of different case materials to suit different tastes .",

So yur user interface , guys , is basically aspects of a computer system that we can see or hear , or otherwise perceive . , commands and mechanisms , that basically user uses to control the operator operating system . Here's a d series of different remote controls that are out on the market today . the following are a bunch of different interface concepts . voice recognition , we we actually have some new information from our research design team current voice recognition starts up to about eighty speech samples , and basically you record your own verbal labels c and connect them to the remote control . our design team , research team , has been able to set up a system in which you can teach the remote control voice c recognition system to respond to  with standard responses . Like you could say good morning remote control and it'll say in a sexy female voice , Good morning Joe . . , another concept is what Apple has come up with , the spinning wheel with L_C_ display like on the iPod and then we have the scroll button with integrated push-button , kind of like a modern  a bit bulky , a bit crazy , I don't think that's we're necessarily going for .

That would include some  mostly just the simple design features for a television operation but with a slide or a fold-out bay for more advanced functions for users . the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ were asked to go ahead and start developing a prototype for us to look at .",

        "text": "Speaker industrial designer: we have assembled our prototype , . , we took into account a lot of the things that we went over in the last meeting , . Some of the most important things to consider are that we decided not to go for the touch screen and opted for some very large buttons for the primary functions , . This is going to be the on off button and we have these buttons to go through the channels and then two volume buttons down here , d we decided those were the most important buttons . And then , for the more advanced functions there is a slide out panel here and you can see that there are lots of other things going on . and provides a very nice aesthetic when it's all put away , . As far as the whole visible light thing , we decided to go with the multiple colours coming out , Of course , if that's annoying for some people that function can be turned off . . Speaker user interface: we talked a quite a bit about you know the the interchangeable faces and what we've done here is come up with a bit of a natural look here f we call it fruity of course that's interchangeable and I think it would be desirable for the for the regular product in the in the in the in the first packaging to be something a little bit more subdued but this is kind of something that can be done and as you can see on the television there we have the voice detector device on the top there . . So that that will work quite well with with regard to finding this contraption . if you give it a touch it does have actually a bit of a spongy feel , clearly there's gonna be some more colours and what not available . Speaker industrial designer: I worried about the materials ,  the entire thing is covered in a rubber coating it's not gonna break like some types of plastic that's dropped . and if you touch it it does have that nice squishy feel . I dunno if you noticed , but I wrote the the company's name on the telephone screen , Speaker user interface: , but I think that's  I think that sums up the main features of our  of the remote , , did we come in under budget ? Speaker industrial designer: to put this into production , we're looking at about  It was twelve fifty Euro and this actually came in at about eleven ninety nine .  obviously we had a choice with the buttons whether to use scroll buttons or standard rubber buttons , but we just went for a classic rubber button So even though it has a lot of modern technology , for example the voice recognition , in a lot of ways it's just a simple remote Speaker user interface:  Did we talk about the voice recognition option ? on the back here you all noticed this area here which is actually the voice recognition console and I think it's nicely designed into the into the overall look . , but basically the voice recognition incorporates the latest designs that our research team has been able to cufw come up with . and , I think that has given a proven  ease of use and what not . And allows features like the remote actually talking back to the user , so . Speaker marketing expert:  Do we have other , for lack of a better word , skins ? Covers ? or are those ones gonna be developed later once we see how the couple we have g go or ? Speaker user interface: we didn't quite have enough material  . Speaker industrial designer: as you can see this is just a most superficial layer and it'd be very easy to put another layer of something else like  Speaker user interface: Actually this bottom red ring here just unclips and then you put a a new a new a new plate on top of that . we definitely priced out a spongy  even spongier non-natural look materials We also continued on with the ideas that f following Apple's colour schemes with the kind of the light orange and the green . Speaker industrial designer: It's not it's not quite a a face plate , it's more like a pseudo-face plate it locks into place such that , you know , it's pretty permanent but at the same time , if we wanna go the other way it's just a matter of a couple of adjustments and we could go the face plate way Speaker marketing expert: Very cool , nice job .",

Speaker user interface: The voice recognition area actually doubles as as the solar cell area . Yeah . Speaker project manager:  It's a s a speaker and a sensor at the same time and the case , it's more of a single-curved case ,  and we've got a rubber skin material basically throughout . . Push button interface with this other drop-down so maybe we've got two push button interfaces Speaker industrial designer: And s I guess you have to mark special colour and special form as well , 'Cause it i it is very unconventional , Speaker marketing expert: M come in at sixteen ? Speaker project manager: a bit over budget , . what we could do perhaps , a simple fix would maybe to switch away from the solar cells  or take out the back-up battery .  Speaker user interface: I think that if we're talking about it being one of our main selling features , being environmental and without the batteries and what not , Speaker industrial designer: I mean we could take we could take the battery out of it you see but you're gonna have to set up a call centre for that one per cent of the time and saying oh look my remote isn't working I think in the long-run it's better to keep the battery , Speaker marketing expert: I mean obviously the solar cell is a big piece of the way we're marketing this as like a natural , new thing , but honestly if we cut that one piece out we're actually coming in under budget Speaker user interface: I mean you might be able to sway me on the idea that  we  our main selling point could be already this voice recognition thing I mean that's what sets us apart Speaker marketing expert: perhaps when the cell technology comes down in price we can bring that back into the game Speaker user interface: And the reality is you know , for me from an ideological stand point , I'd like to stick with the the solar cell , but I h kind of have to throw myself in the in the business structure model here and you know I think I think that I think that we need to come to a compromise here and maybe move ahead with the project , without the solar cell . Speaker marketing expert: I think unfortunately that's our best option . Speaker project manager: 'Cause we can't remove the push buttons , nor would changing the case materials .

Does it respond to voice recognition ? , the only thing is with with the pull-out panel , that is , can it take some adjusting And overall , in general , it looks like it's coming up to par . but then , once you get used to it , it does make a lot of sense . So I think overall we're headed in the right direction . Speaker user interface: They like that spongy feel .

I guess this is the point where we go  out of role it looks like and talk about our satisfaction for room for creativity and so forth and how that all worked , I guess , . Speaker marketing expert: As in within the team or ? Speaker project manager: I think so yeah . Speaker industrial designer: Are we considering these points here ? Speaker marketing expert: I think they're starting blocks I think in general , for a day's worth of work we actually were  relatively productive , considering the little amount of input we had going in . , and the technology has definitely been a help , it's really been interesting to try out all this new stuff . Speaker user interface: We didn't use the whiteboard at all . Speaker project manager: No , no whiteboard .  Speaker marketing expert: and I feel like if you guys had been designing in here perhaps that would have changed but because of room constraints , doesn't really matter . Speaker user interface: , also had I not been intrigued about the pen , I don't think I woulda used it at all , I didn't write barely anything . Speaker project manager: Was pretty cool tack though . Speaker marketing expert: I am disappointed I didn't get a note back from my personal coach .  Speaker project manager: Attempts to contact coach ineffective  . Speaker user interface: n I think there was a lot of room for creativity , we could do whatever  basically what we wanted until the budget came down on us , . Speaker marketing expert: And even then we did get a decent product turned out although it's not everything we wanted it to be . Speaker project manager: I think , yeah re I thought it was like really creative actually , I mean . Speaker user interface:  I think the teamwork was good as well . Speaker industrial designer: My one my one criticism is that we didn't have enough colours to work with , Speaker marketing expert: You could have developed multiple skins really had you had more colours . Speaker project manager: What did you guys think about the the the roles ? Speaker industrial designer: I think it was pretty clever 'cause we were never able to get too far off track because the information came in at the right time and kind of filled in the gaps enough . At the same time you had enough room to kind of just make things up , Speaker marketing expert: Though I did feel like th the level of information dropped off severely over the course of the day . but I didn't actually get any information for the last presentation at all . Nothing , I didn't even get an email , I feel like that was slightly lacking Speaker user interface: when I was reporting about what each of us was doing I was often confused as to what you were doing  and then I also felt like you know a lot of our discussion would centre around n specifically what my task was and then in the end I think our jobs kind of melded together a little bit more , Speaker industrial designer: I think the most helpful thing out of everything was getting the the PowerPoint slides already put together for you Speaker marketing expert: Yeah , already having the formatted stuff helped a lot . Speaker industrial designer: 'cause if we didn't have that there's no way we could have got all that done in time . Speaker user interface: And I think your leadership was quite good . Speaker industrial designer: It was really good yeah . Speaker project manager: I did get  I I felt like I got way too into it . But you guys felt that you could keep the , yeah , suspension of disbelief kind of like like the role and the  okay ? Speaker marketing expert: except for a couple moments where it just got out of hand Speaker project manager: you guys felt like there was enough teamwork in all ? Speaker marketing expert: I think so . Speaker project manager: No I , no I dunno , I d I I dunno , Speaker marketing expert: I mean other than minor discussion at meetings there wasn't  except for the actual building , but I feel like if this was a team project there actually would have been much more of the collaborative like brainstorming , use the board  and this would have been six months' worth of work , not like three hours' worth of meetings . Speaker industrial designer: is there anything about the way that we got so much inform what was it that kept us from going to the the board ? Speaker marketing expert: I didn't feel like getting up and down and dealing with all these wires , I was afraid I was gonna break something actually . Speaker industrial designer: and each time you get up it's s a possibility of tripping over something or getting tangled or . Speaker user interface: I dunno what I woulda shown on that board . it's just like the paper I don't know what I really needed the paper for . Speaker industrial designer: Usually I would do a lot more doodling too Speaker marketing expert: I felt like I needed to be professional Speaker project manager: I I'm curious about what the de-briefing is gonna be like . Speaker user interface: is this all we need to get through ? Speaker project manager: I'm not sure what the new ideas found i is about . Speaker marketing expert: It  did it just say in an email that we need to discuss that ? Speaker project manager: that's the thing I got  i in the email I got this PowerPoint file I didn't change this one at all . Speaker user interface: Any new ideas with regard to remote control concepts ?  Speaker marketing expert: I think they still do their job . Speaker project manager: how much can you do with a remote control ? Speaker marketing expert: how long was our meeting supposed to be ? Speaker project manager: I I I we should go on a bit  yeah  about the project eval , . I dunno about you guys but I felt like a bit under-stimulated on the whole thing . Speaker marketing expert: at the beginning it started out and I felt actually like under pressure and I was like  had like all this brainstorming I was doing and then suddenly I was like well it's just another two minute presentation that you guys don't really care about anyway like we all sort of knew where we were headed with it Speaker industrial designer: Definitely when  when I first filled out the questionnaire I was marking it probably higher in terms of how much I had to  how much I stressed over it and then by the time I got to the last one I was like , you know , not very much . Speaker user interface: Think it was also realisation of you basically just copy and paste what's given to you into your presentation Speaker project manager: every single one I  a all the presentations I either added slides or edited 'em . Speaker marketing expert: My slides were all blank , they'd have a title maybe with the whole new background being innovative , yeah that was class . An interesting day all in all I would say .

Speaker industrial designer:   I think it's important that you should be able to  when you when you press the buttons it'll actually pick up the signals from kind of anywhere and you shouldn't have to like contort yourself Speaker marketing expert: Think a lot of the time , remotes that come with T_V_ players and  T_V_s and D_V_ players , like they aren't they're very boring , making a a stylish remote control would be a very like  Easily put us one step ahead of the current competition .  .

Speaker user interface: But maybe they could be concave instead of sticking up to have them  be kind of down Speaker project manager: must admit I don't think I've ever seen one with concave buttons , I can't think of any re remote controls that I know of that actually light up at all . Andrew have you had any thoughts yet about how we might market something Speaker marketing expert: we could have parallel marketing s schemes where you've got one where it appeals to people that want to have the new device that looks cool , is fashionable it's it's like it's one that rather than ra I wan I want rather than a kind of a need relationship with the device , I think it's  this is gonna have to appeal to people that want device that can enhance their living room Speaker industrial designer: They they just need to be very very dependable because people sort of take them for granted it needs to be very effective , very  always dependable . but also if you make it too small kinda like you know how mobile phones are getting smaller and smaller , it's just gonna end up under a couch cushion somewhere and yeah . Speaker user interface: most  I think most of the remote controls now are either just black or grey , I was just thinking of  what they're doing with mobile phones now how you can get the different  what are they called ? Like the face-plates I don't know if it would be feasible to do something with that , so people can get different different things . Speaker project manager: Again I don't think that's ever been done before , Speaker marketing expert: but  maybe thinking of that , it's  considering the nature of the device , maybe a second thing  like a second campaign to market new facials for your  to your  might go a bit astray since it is the kind of thing where y you generally get one Speaker industrial designer: you could come up with like novelty ones ,",

And general opinions about current current remotes . See that , as we kinda noticed , seventy five percent of people find their remote controls ugly . along with looking less ugly , if it looks better , eighty percent of people said they'd spend more money on it . Current remote controls do not match the operating behaviour of the user . I kinda take that to mean as  they they don't  they , yeah , they only use  they only work for the television as in in my flat I've got six remote controls for a stereo system , a digital box , a D_V_D_ player , a video player and T_V_ . again , seventy five percent is  seventy five percent of users say they zap a lot . fifty percent users only use ten percent of the buttons , we'll have some buttons taken off by the lack of teletext , but oh and we're going to see on the  that some of the functions like audio settings aren't h hardly ever used So I think maybe fewer buttons , which also make the design look sleeker , frustrations of like people losing remote control . maybe some kind of system of you press a button on the T_V_ it would have to incorporate  , but like some kind of system where you can f use something else to find the remote control . Maybe like it'll beep or something . the time taken to learn new remote controls is  And repetitive strain injury , I suppose we should make it more comfortable like I was saying about the whole mice  the mouse idea of it feels more comfortable . Maybe don't even have to hold it as such . It also asked if we would  if people would pay more for speech recognition and younger people say they would .

Speaker project manager: If people really don't use those buttons to any extent at all  remove them altogether . I wonder whether we could get the remote control with no buttons at all if we went for voice recognition , what we didn't have was what proportion of people using remotes were in those particular age groups . Forty  no sorry  for forty five to fifty five age group , to put myself right in the middle of it , u use remote controls to a great extent . again , we don't know the relative proportion  the relative numbers in the age groups .

Speaker project manager: But if you just lift it up and say , channel one or B_B_C_  Speaker marketing expert: You could just put it down once on top your T_V_ Speaker user interface: and then it doesn't matter where in the room you are , Speaker project manager: I can I can see technical problems with that in terms of the , you know , the sound from the television , because if somebody actually on the television says , you know , I_T_V_ and you're watching B_B_C_ then then it might change itself , so it probably needs to be  possibly actually need a button on it Or or something just to identify that you've lifted it up and it's use . w we need to s identify things that  people actually need and and it's a function of frequency and relevance .  if we can design something that that looks interesting , incorporates the the logo and and the colours and we can still have our interchangeable fascias even if it's  the yellow and grey , buttons or or buttons as an option .

Speaker project manager: inevitably a b a custom design chip is gonna be more expensive . Do we do we know by how much ? Speaker industrial designer: I don't actually have any price information , Speaker project manager: And and do we know how long it'll take to develop a a custom chip . Speaker industrial designer: a lot longer than an off the shelf chip .

I mean given that we've got you know one one on off button presumably , two buttons for channel change and one slider and basically nothing else , w we need to decide on the  just the basic shape of the thing . And , know whether we go down the fruit and veg route , and I don't suggest we make it look like a banana , but know sort of the the organic , you know , curved look , t to deliberately get away from the  you know , the the the the square look of most current remotes and , you know , whether whether the you know , the the fixed part of it is the corporate yellow . 'cause there's certainly you know , the the corporate logo needs to be prominently displayed Speaker industrial designer: I dunno that we should make the whole thing yellow yellow seems a bit of a strong colour Speaker project manager: I mean we're we're we're simply  it's simply required to incorporate the the the the corporate logo prominently . Speaker user interface: I was sort of kinda picturing like maybe  a shape that's almost like a mouse . because a mouse is pretty comfortable to hold in your hand maybe we could make it a slightly different shape but that way they can have the volume on the side and then the channel buttons and Speaker project manager: my idea was something a b probably you know a bit fatter than this but sort of tha that sorta shape so that you can just sort of ho hold it . Speaker industrial designer: you'd want it narrower than a mouse though 'cause it  a mouse you're kinda just resting on it , you want something you can definitely grip . Speaker project manager: so it's  you sorta hold it in your hand like that , i with , you know , and fiddling with the buttons . Speaker user interface: kind of maybe maybe a little wider than this , Speaker industrial designer: and then it widens up top Speaker user interface: And then it would have a l wider thing to have the light , the infrared light at the T_V_ and just kinda change channels and adjust the volume and the power could be wherever , up up the top or something . Speaker marketing expert: I'm just  I'm suddenly realising that yeah we're discussing how much  how good it's gonna be to change channels I mean are we are we starting to get away from the the voice functionality of it ? Speaker project manager: I think we d I think we decided that w we're actually going down both routes . we need the the manual controls Speaker marketing expert: we're leaving out the buttons for the the f less frequently used stuff , but maybe we could incorporate that into the voice . Speaker project manager: my personal view is that if it's not there , people wouldn't use it anyway . Speaker industrial designer: you can still i incorporate the voice with with less buttons . if the power button was also somehow like a menu button you could press that and  or do voice commands , and  either volume thing could also be to scroll through other options like y and you could scroll through brightness Speaker project manager: I'm getting a clear message that we think that we should have those facilities available . Speaker user interface: We could have the channels and the power and then a menu button and then the volume . Speaker project manager: if we if we're going down that route , then we need some sort of display . Speaker industrial designer: But the television would be the display Speaker project manager: We actually use the television , okay . Okay , okay , okay . Speaker industrial designer: like you hit menu and menu will come up on television Speaker user interface: so if you had like the menu then you could scroll through and then click it to select . Speaker marketing expert: Our energy source is gonna be Speaker project manager: for simplicity of , you know , manufacturing and maintenance that we will go for a a long term battery source , and  make an assumption that we we can aim for a battery that will last most people for we'll say at least five five ten years Speaker marketing expert: And interchangeable case ? Speaker project manager: I i interchangeable case seems to be  important to the concept . it it should be cheap , you know , if if we avoid any , you know , electrical connections . i if we can come up with some way of of allowing people to actually personalise it to whatever they want , then  I mean this is totally new . We d we don't know whether that  to what extent people do it or not , but if they've at least got a a good selection of covers that they can use anyway , so they can get them in the supermarket when they go down to a any of the famous supermarkets , Speaker marketing expert: And are we gonna have it il being illuminated from inside onto the buttons or  Speaker project manager: because we've got so few buttons that it  that actually makes that redundant . no ,  cer certainly wider angle than than current , so that if you're holding it , you know , anyway like you're likely to and it's  you know , i i it will work most of the time . I sorta envisaged that if if this was the the thing , then sort of the the whole of the top would be the the infrared .",

And if we devote some energy into this , I think the recent productions of Real Reaction , the I go everywhere power and the high definition D_V_D_ players  although it makes immediate sense to  have our remote control interact with these , I think we can also use this as a platform to make it interact with other tools . again , most users really dislike the current look and feel of remote controls . fifty percent of user say they only use ten percent of the buttons . eighty percent would spend more money on a remote control that looks fancy . Speaker industrial designer: Could  can I ask where these figures come from , Speaker marketing expert: it was market research and there were a hundred people in the room , so eighty out of a hundred said they would spend more money . and s specifically wanted to find out information about speech recognition . the early adopters , those of us who grew up with technology and luck lucky for us have the cash to to pay for it , the young age group without the mortgages and responsibilities , ninety one percent of them  would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . I I leave this up to the group to decide if we wanna use this if  and you know , the the designers , but ninety one percent , fifteen to twenty five  I mean s three quarters of the next age group , twenty five to thirty five are interested , Speaker project manager: In real numbers , does the ninety one percent and the seventy six percent translate to ex in excess of the four million ?

I think we need a more streamlined volume with no extraneous functions . my method was to look at the existing remotes and what functions they have . And what we all need to discuss is whether we want these functions pretty much the same as what existing remotes have . If we can build on this with the speech recognition , that's not something I'd thought about at all , and and I presume we can miss out the functions really to to a video or D_V_D_ remote control , if this is only gonna be a , you know , satellite , cable , T_V_ remote control . these are two models of existing remote controls . the one on the left seems to be a fairly standard universal remote control . It has fast-forward , stop , play , all relating to movies . It also has  seems to have channel up and channel down , but I think we should be looking more along the lines of the one on the right , which has  it also has play , stop and pause and everything , I don't think we need them at all . I think we just need channel selection , volume up , volume down and I think an an enter function where you can access  it's not like teletext , but along the same lines , access things on the screen . not related to the internet one that you mentioned , because that'd be far outside our budget and what we want this to do . I was thinking something  some smooth , sleek , little remote control with big user-friendly buttons and a menu that you can access . but then I do think we need to discuss the speech recognition possibility .

I've been doing a little bit of web-based research , But the the net result is that I've come up with a first cut for the working design that I'd like to discuss with you . let's go back to what the basic function of a remote control is . It's for sending a message , typically via infrared .  And the the basic components we've got to build in for our twelve Euros fifty are an energy source , the user interface which will in incorporate an integrated circuit that actually composes the message based on what the  which buttons the user presses , we turn that into a message , and then we need a sending mechanism to send it to the receiver . we want an energy source And we've got to think about what that might be . typically it would be a battery , but I'm open to suggestions .  then we have the the user interface . And the main components in there are the the th the chip that translates button presses into a message , and sends the message to the receiver . Speaker project manager: what what does it look like ? What do the buttons look like ? That's where the user interface is really coming into its own . The technical end is what's actually gonna be in there , or what if the chip , for whatever reason , breaks down after a certain amount of time , do you just replace it ? does it have to have a a way of being segregated from the others , in a different frequency or something ? Speaker industrial designer: but I'd been thinking of this device as being a a cheap mass-produced device . I may be wrong here , and I hadn't thought of it as being a reparable thing , I like the idea of speech recognition , that's a great idea , but I'm not convinced we can put it into this box for the price that we need  gonna need to hit . Speaker marketing expert: Do we have ki some idea of how much it would cost to create a device that has these basic elements ?

You could  you know , you just plug into a power source for a couple of hours , and then it's recharged for ages and ages and ages , and you don't have to worry with replacing A_A_ batteries , Speaker marketing expert: which is if every time you're done using the remote you put it on a charger , then you  then it has a place .

Speaker industrial designer: I think that's a very interesting idea , and I don't know much about what these things cost . Speaker marketing expert: it's better than my idea about solar , probably .  Speaker industrial designer: solar may not be so good when you're watching T_V_ in the night , Speaker project manager: It would have to sor store up the energy M yeah , that would be too heavy and it'd cost too much .

Speaker marketing expert: but I think you raised some good questions about are there enough of these people out there , or are they making purchasing decisions ? Speaker industrial designer:  Bu but what I was gonna say was , although they they may be buying , you know , personal music devices and all that , are they necessarily buying T_V_ remote controls ? Speaker marketing expert:  It might be good to know who , you know , who's actually buying televisions Speaker project manager: Or do we s make sure that it goes to the man through the manufacturer ? We sell to the manufacturer as the remote that goes with it . Speaker user interface: That's probably more what it is .  We're not gonna get any resolutions by the end of the day , Speaker project manager: Our functions , we've so far decided , I think , that power , channel , volume make it attractive . the other thing that we're supposed to do is make decision on our functions . It has to have big user-friendly buttons it has to have an enter key and of course the number keys . and sh n  definitely we wanna be inspired that the current  styles are just plain awful . Speaker marketing expert: my only comment is I think maybe we could somehow include an enter key in like a power key if power power was enter and pow that was my only  just really in terms of streamlining . Speaker project manager: Enter , power as a s oh a sum simultaneous key . Speaker industrial designer: H how does that work ? how do you avoid switching the thing off when you actually wanna press enter ? Speaker marketing expert: if you're pressing enter , the the thing would already be on , and so maybe when you press power , initially it turns it on , press power again and use that as an enter  Speaker project manager: Then you'd have to have an off te off key . Speaker marketing expert: I was thinking maybe you  to turn it off you'd have to press power twice in succession , Speaker industrial designer: It's not getting a bit complicated ? Speaker marketing expert: Or something that has a a turning dial , where at the far end is on or off .  It's definitely channel , volume , power . Speaker user interface: things like screen settings and audio settings , I would generally do them on the actual television itself , like here you have a you know , a little flap th with a little control panel on the actual box itself . Speaker project manager: As you said , you know , don't make it too hard for the granny .  Speaker user interface: We didn't come to any sort of decision on the functions though . Speaker project manager: I think I went over the functions and wrote them down that's what I went over and nobody was objecting to them . Speaker marketing expert: could you reiterate the new project requirements , Speaker project manager: the teletext is outdated , and it must include the corporate image , colour and slogan it's only to be for a T_V_ Speaker user interface: is that the yellow and black ?

Kate presented a working design of  going after  going over the basics on the whiteboard that it should be a simple mass-produced device , because of the twelve and a half Pence cost . but we did talk about possibly using rechargeable batteries and having a docking place as a selling point . we agreed that the target market would be fifteen to thirty five with more money than sense , that were decision makers . Alternatively it would be a manufacturer to enclose it with the T_V_ , and that the function we agreed was volume , power , numbers , enter , channels , a way to move between channels , easy to use and hand-held .  at that point we agreed that Sarah would look at the current cost of competition , what what do the current ones sell for . and Steph was gonna look at ec ergonomics .

And this is a push-button one , so you see these little little buttons here , they're little rubber rubber buttons that go through onto the the board at the back and they push these buttons here . that's the basic construction that we've got to got to accommodate . We got to have something that pushes the little buttons that talk to the chip that encodes the message that sends the the message to the receiver .  So first of all I wanna talk about what possibilities we've got for the energy source . we can have your bog standard double double A_ batteries in a replaceable little compartment . We can have a hand   a wind-up , yeah , but i it maybe is  doesn't quite go with the the fruit and veg .   one that one that I think is quite interesting is the kinetic energy source , where  you you actually get the energy by moving the device , Or we we had talked about solar power , but I thing that we agreed that that's not so good in the dark . I'm afraid this is the options we've got on on the case . It can be made of plastic , rubber , wood o if you like ,  or titanium . and the nearest we've got to st to spongy there I guess is rubber , and basically it can have a flat surface , a curved surface or a double curved surface , but I think if we wanna use standard components , we're gonna have difficulty with anything much beyond that . what does the interface look like ? push button , that's that's the one we're all familiar with .  we can have scroll buttons and the the scroll button can incorporate a push , so you can have it like on a mouse where you can use it to go up and down , change volume or channel or something like that and push to select something .  you can have multiple scroll buttons , And we can also incorporate an L_C_D_ display in the remote , but this will increase the cost .   the electronics that actually makes the device work , we've basically got three , simple , regular , advanced , If we want the nice cheap one , the simple , then we can only have push buttons . pay a little bit more for a regular chip and you can have scroll buttons . And the manufacturing devision tell me that they have recently developed sample sensor sample speaker devices . I don't know what that is , but I think they think it's quite important I I think we've got two options . We can either go for a really cheap model , keep all of the costs down , Or we can have something that looks a bit nicer , I think it , won't necessarily l look like a pineapple ,   but it could have an L_C_D_ screen and it could have multiple scroll buttons , Speaker marketing expert: do you have any idea if if this could  if the fancy model could be done in twelve Euros fifty ? Speaker industrial designer: and it could have the the company's new development of the sample sensor and speaker .  I'm afraid I don't have that information available . manufacturing didn't actually give  attach any prices to any of this , I'm afraid . Speaker user interface: so what I had been thinking was something chunky and yellow and plastic with black buttons with a logo on it . I I don't know how important that is to keep it exactly the colours of the Real Reaction company . That's before I heard about all this hot tips about the future , fruit-wise .

        "text": "Speaker user interface: I don't actually have a huge amount of different information then what Kate says , just that my method was to look at the , well , my my inspirations , which was a big collection of lots of different models of remote controls and other things that use a similar sort of thing , including M_P_ three players , like you know , hi-fi remotes , not just television and these things . having a think about the feature of ea the features of each ones ,  I've been especially interested in the iPod style scroll wheel , what functions we actually need , but it had a similar thing to this thing on the right . It has scroll wheels without without a display , So I was thinking that  a really simple a really simple interface with just a couple of scroll things on it and then instead of a display the display could appear on the television screen . and it comes up with what's showing on that channel at the moment , you can scroll along and you can see what's on the other channels while you're watching the same channel on the screen . but I'm also equally taken with this chunky plastic kiddie remote , which is really nice and fun and good to hold and nice , big , easy buttons to press , but still quite simple and quite cost effective . what seems kind of ideal for me would be to just have a fairly simple , not fancy but not totally minimalist , I mean just pretty simple plastic , probably , I was thinking , yellow and black , just because that's the company's colours , with very very few buttons , but that would correspond to a screen that would appear on the television screen , like , you know ,  just small along the bottom Speaker industrial designer: Yeah , I'd I'd certainly support that idea . Speaker user interface: But as for actually arranging them  let me go back to the to the picture of the kiddie one . And I quite like it , 'cause it's just smooth and hand-held and it's got these easily reachable buttons so something a bit like that with buttons arranged in a kind of circle . Up , down , left , right . Speaker industrial designer: Do you want scroll buttons in that as well ? Speaker user interface: I I was thinking not actually scroll , like a like mouse scroll , like this s style thing where you c have up , down , left and right . And enter in the middle , and when when you click on each one , it  you can go into a new menu for that . And and I definitely support the use of plastic and or rubber . I mean titanium would be great , but I think it might be a bit too expensive and too kinda spacey . If we're k trying to keep it colourful and slightly organic , then I think titanium's too futuristic . Speaker industrial designer: we can't for example have a double curved case in titanium unfortunately . Speaker user interface: Whereas a plastic's so cheap and easy and mouldable and everything else . Speaker industrial designer:  And the the having the the the screen on the television screen I think is a good idea , I think I think that's a g nice clean design , Speaker user interface: But they all have this this feature of this  It's not quite a scroll wheel , but it's a kind of selection in this circle , Speaker industrial designer: But we can implement it with simple push buttons , Speaker user interface: either a channel up and down , volume up and down , next appearing programmes up and down ,  and then also  when you get into the different menus on the screen , it's got your things like settings and contrast up and down . So all you really need is these four buttons with the enter in the middle . Speaker marketing expert:  It seems that that you guys are quite keen on the plastic , Do you think we could put it in a in a fruit colour ? And have it abstract . we could call  like a fruit name , Speaker industrial designer: . We we could actually do it in rubber instead of plastic if you'd rather  if you feel  if you like the spongy  Speaker marketing expert: I'm thinking maybe we need to be a little bit more abstract if the design constraints are so  Speaker user interface: just something else I need to bring to your attention This is actually the volume up and down , but  they both say V_ on them , so we do need to avoid little ambiguities like these . But we wouldn't have a specific volume up and down . If we're having the scroll wheel , then it's gonna double up as all the other up and down functions .",

They want us to decide what form of energy are we going to use , which  the choices that we've discussed were pretty much battery , kinetic or solar . You were saying that the kinetic would be useful , as opposed to a battery that you have to either put it in a recharger or keep replacing the batteries . or solar that you'd have difficulty with it if it's a dark day , that it'll die on you , and no way to do it . Speaker industrial designer: unfortunately I don't have costing information . I i in terms of workability , I I think the the two front-runners are the standard battery or the kinetic , Speaker project manager: What's the feelings of the group on the kinetic ?

Speaker marketing expert: We'll put price up at the top . Speaker user interface:  Not that we actually know anything about it , Speaker marketing expert: wha how do we feel in terms of is this fancy ? Speaker user interface: It depends what what you mean by fancy really , I'd call these quite minimalist , Speaker industrial designer: a plain , simple , clean design . Speaker user interface: it is heavily reliant on appearance instead of pure functionality , I think just maybe we need a different word other than fancy ,  like stylish or aesthetic . Speaker marketing expert: in terms of elegant , fancy . we'll call it E_F_ , do we do we think that perhaps  and maybe we should say the yellow ? Speaker user interface: they're both yellow with black buttons , but if you can just imagine banana shape with these bits as black . So what we re really need to decide is whether we want the actual banana shape or just a a purely blob or some sort of abstraction in between the two but that isn't actually recognisable as a banana , you know , with the grooves and the stalk and stuff , Speaker marketing expert: I think that many of us are abstract enough to look at the yellow one and say we'll call it the banana . And of the two I really like I m I like the banana , Speaker user interface: that's maybe not something we have to decide just right now , Speaker project manager: I think between the two , somewhere between the two is true . It's more true than false , about a two . Speaker marketing expert:  technologically innovative . Speaker industrial designer: I think we're using simple components that are gonna be robust but not particularly innovative . Speaker marketing expert: we'll say  we'll say false . Easy to use .  One , trendy , s  and I say specifically spongy fruity . Speaker user interface: maybe only a two or a three then , we still haven't decided about specific sponginess or specific  Speaker industrial designer: We have the worry about how robust it will be if it's it's curved as a banana but spongy . Speaker user interface: Yeah , I don't really think that's gonna work , Speaker marketing expert: two ? are there excess buttons ?   That is false .  good , well designed buttons , intuitive buttons . Speaker project manager: Better , more intuitive buttons , yes . Speaker marketing expert: Ugly . Speaker user interface: No .  Speaker industrial designer: I think they're different , Speaker user interface: it is quite it is quite quirky I think . It could be quite a good brand , like a good little object . Speaker marketing expert: could we say it's cost saving ? Speaker user interface: we also need tho think about the energy . Is it the kinetic energy ? it is gonna be environmentally friendly with the kinetic energy . but we haven't completely developed that side of it yet , Speaker marketing expert: do you have any idea about price or other features ? Speaker industrial designer: I think our instinct is that it should be pretty cheap to develop . Speaker marketing expert: So true one Speaker user interface: I would say maybe a two , Speaker marketing expert: And I'm gonna actually change a couple of these instead of ugly I'm gonna say it's attractive and then make that true , 'cause I have to do an average .  And then excess buttons . Speaker user interface: Just putting no excess buttons . Speaker marketing expert: so it doesn't ruin the polarity . Speaker user interface: see if we're technologically innovative , I'd say it is quite innovative , because there aren't really many that have this menu idea instead of all the extra buttons . I mean I know we're not doing anything involving internet or speech recognition but but we are at the upper end of the push button market .  Speaker marketing expert: let me know if if any of these  if you if you all can think of any other thing to change here  if you th if you think I should change the innovative or add other features . If not I'll average those . and I'll figure out the average here . Thank you for everyone's help with that .",

Speaker project manager: Okay , so so basically we're looking for some  we're looking for a device that is robust and and therefore won't get damaged too easily . Speaker industrial designer: sort of easy to use so the buttons are accessible .

And one of the most annoying things is having like five remotes in the house . So if you've got a combined system , it could be a combined remote .

Speaker marketing expert: one of the things we found from the market research is that people often get confused by the number of buttons on them as well . Speaker user interface: Or is it just a television that we're supposed to be doing ? Speaker project manager: 'cause  as you rightly said , there's nothing more annoying than having three or four devices littered about the about the room . So a device for for all remotes .

Speaker marketing expert: That's that's maybe something for the future when you can talk to your television , but   Speaker industrial designer: Maybe we could have better instructions with the remote . Speaker marketing expert: I mean we've done some research about sort of you know what the cutting edge sort of hand held devices are , Speaker project manager: You can't have both the th the one device and then have few buttons on it to  'cause you want you want simplicity as well , Whilst at the same time you want , as you rightly said , one remote for all .

Speaker marketing expert: I mean we're maybe talking about replacing remotes for slightly older televisions , so we maybe need to keep the the tuning function in .  Speaker industrial designer: Would you maybe have like one menu button , then you'd use the other buttons , maybe the number buttons to actually do the separate functions . Speaker user interface: Yeah , 'cause you do need kind of brightness and contrast and everything as well . Well , if we're trying to keep it slee sleek and sexy as well , have you seen those remotes where kind of the bottom bit slides down , so there's kind of everything else revealed ? So you don't use it that much , Speaker industrial designer: That is that is a good idea actually . Speaker project manager: So so keep keep detailed functions hidden at the back . Speaker user interface: And that'll be better for the older generation as well Speaker industrial designer: So  we're gonna have to have to work out what's gonna be on these other functions as as well . Speaker marketing expert: The detailed ones would be sort of brightness , Speaker project manager: So on front , Speaker industrial designer:  about the number  . the volume up and down . A mute button as well . Speaker marketing expert: And probably a power one as well . Speaker project manager:  So so are you having the stand-by on the front , then ? Speaker industrial designer: are we gonna have the channel up and down as well as the number buttons ? Speaker marketing expert: 'cause yeah the market research said there is quite a lot of people do just zap around and flick , so . Speaker industrial designer: So we've got ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen there ? Speaker marketing expert: Numbers is ten , volume is twelve , And a mute , yeah . Speaker project manager: And then at the back ? Speaker marketing expert: You've got brightness and contrast . Speaker industrial designer: Maybe if we're gonna run out of time , one of us should come up with a list of these and then get back at the next meeting just at the start and say what they're gonna be . Speaker user interface: there's audio functions . Speaker project manager: You're also gonna have the channel tuner  , as it were . Speaker marketing expert: And then maybe sort of an enter button for sort of s you know , saying that you want that particular thing tuned in . Speaker user interface: So I think there's quite a lot of like Dolby surround studio , surround sort of things . Speaker industrial designer: Do they have their own  do they have their own controls on their actual products , then , Speaker user interface: I think they've got their own controls in this kind of like hidden panel .

We still have the user interface which is all the buttons we're gonna incorporate . Then there is a chip and still the sender . So yes  including the power s supply as well . first in the power supply , we have the option of just the standard battery , There's a dynamo . There's a kinetic option , which would mean the batteries wouldn't have to be replaced . but I think that was gonna cost a little more . And then there's solar cells . as a final option . For the buttons , we have an integrated push button , which I guess is just the same as the standard ones . This says it's similar to the button on the mouse for a normal  for like like modern computer . there's a scroll wheel which is  you know the new mouse has just got like the centre section which you can scroll up and down , one issue for the buttons is , depending on which material we use , if we use rubber buttons then it requires a rubber case , Speaker project manager: What would be the cost do do we know ? Speaker industrial designer: I th I think the there wasn't too much difference in the cost , that that related to the actual buttons , but it does affect the printed circuit board . The firm supplies a simple , a regular and an advanced circuit board . So if we've got the scroll wheel for one of the buttons , that would require a slightly more advanced circuit board than if we just had a standard push button . one final thing we came up with was some information on the speech recognition . There's a small unit available through the company which obviously would be an extra cost , going to my personal preferences , I thought possibly for power we could use kinetic And this would avoid batteries running out , having to replace batteries and such like . for the buttons , I thought we'd probably get away with just having the standard push buttons rather than the scroll wheel . So if we wanted the scroll wheel and wanted the voice recognition , then we'd have to get a a more costly circuit board . and for the circuit board , again depends on which features we want in the actual in the remote . if we're gonna have the speech recognition , we'd have to probably get an advanced one .

Speaker user interface: that's probably a better one , to discuss it straight away . Speaker project manager: so if we wanted to know for instance that the scroll wheel required the regular  and what required advance . Then if we were able to see that down then we could make the decision at that point in time Speaker industrial designer: As I say it only specified that we need a more advanced circuit board for the scroll wheel , The voice recognition came as a separate piece of information . . Speaker project manager: the scroll wheel required the regular , The display requires an advanced chip Speaker industrial designer: And note that the push button just requires a simple chip , Speaker user interface: Yeah , and if we're going for sleek and sexy , I think a scroll wheel is maybe a bit kinda bulky ? Speaker industrial designer: So maybe just a simple push button , Speaker user interface: Yeah , a simple pushbuttons . Speaker industrial designer:  Did everyone get this on the speech recognition ?

The most important thing was that the thing sort of look and felt fancy rather than just functional . And second , there should be some technological innovation . And then third and l less important than the other two , there should be an ease of use as well . And apparently , the fashion trends  are that people want sort of clothes and shoes and things with a fruit and vegetables theme .  but the feel of the material should be spongy , we need to emphasise the fancy design with on on our remote control above all else . And then also try and add in technological informat innovation which could be our sort of find the thing with a hand clap .

The  whether the product demonstrates technical innovation . Whether it's easy to use . Whether it's incorporating sort of the fashion element to attract the buyer . And whether it's a sort of recognisable Real Reaction product . And I have to go up onto the whiteboard and do this apparently , So the first one is , does the product look and feel fancy . Speaker industrial designer: Okay , well we have a single curve , , then we have the rubber kinda spongy feel , which was in at the time . Speaker user interface: Yeah , I'd maybe give it a a two . Speaker marketing expert: What  Is one false , or is t one true ? Speaker user interface: One's true . Speaker marketing expert: So say about a two for fancy , And I mean , how much does the product demonstrate technical innovation do you reckon ? Speaker industrial designer: ,  deciding between the kinetic power or the speech recognition , and if we had either of those for our budget , they both show a reasonable amount of speech recognition . Speaker marketing expert: we've got we've got the speech recognition on it , haven't we . Speaker industrial designer: So it says if we make a slightly more fancy , then we lose points innovation , and if we make it more innovative innovative , then we lose points on it being fancy , so  Speaker project manager: I would go for a one on that at this point in time . , incorporates elements of fashion to attract buyer . Speaker user interface: it's got the cherry and the sponginess . Speaker marketing expert: Say about a three maybe ? Speaker project manager: The product is a recognisable real  r  reaction product ?

Speaker marketing expert:  So this is about sort of the corporate image of like new sort of sleek technology and all that sort of thing , as well as having the logo on and all that .

Do we add them up and rate  or anything ? Speaker marketing expert: I think we sort of add them up so sort of at an average is gonna be  I'm just gonna do this in my head . One point eight isn't it or something . So yeah , pretty close to a two . So it's  I mean it's pretty good at the moment , but it's gonna get worse , isn't it . Speaker industrial designer: So  decide we've lost a little bit on the fashion and lost a bit on the fancy kinda side of it , Speaker project manager: Yeah . So you'd maybe put fash fan fashion at three rather than two .

Speaker project manager: we've  the main thing we've changed really is the casing isn't it ? Speaker marketing expert: So maybe in terms of sort of fanciness and fashionability , we're pretty much the same , maybe . So , I mean we could maybe put two again on them .

Speaker marketing expert: , well I guess , just from my findings it looks like we wanna minimise buttons . Speaker project manager: I think we should definitely go ahead with the alarm system idea that you had . Speaker user interface: Would you be able to , , put the little device anywhere ? so it would need to be something that you could stick somewhere , or something . Speaker project manager: It would be able to use the same reception on the remote c control I guess , but the actual device would have to have its own infrared signaller .

Speaker marketing expert: I just thought that  it , it might be sucking more battery power , if there , if it is a light up . Speaker industrial designer: , so like big b buttons ,  for people you are visually impaired . Speaker marketing expert: I guess the other option , referring to the battery thing is , you know how cellphones will t light up for fifteen seconds or something , when you're s and then it goes , , if instead of a constant light up on the , on the remote control , if it lights up for ten seconds when it's touched again . Speaker project manager: That's probably feasible . , did we want to go for the glow-in-the-dark look ? Or did we want to go for the lighting up instantly ?

Okay , there are lots of different possibilities for the energy source . We could use a basic battery ,  There's a hand-powered dynamo which is a sort of thing that was used for torches fifty years ago . Kinetic energy is something that's been recently developed . Whereas kinetic energy is a new idea that's being used by some watches and other devices , where you just shake the device and it gives it power . , or there's solar power , which we've been considering inside a building , which is where it's gonna be used , might not be quite so useful . , lots of considerations for the case , like what sort of shape it would be , curved or flat . We don't want something that's huge and you can't pick up . we could use metal , we could use rubber which might be more ideal for the anti-R_S_I_ . , titanium is not gonna be possible , even though it just it beyond our budget really . right our choice for buttons as well . with our research team have found some new multiple option scroll buttons . they're basically quite a flexible design , modern , you don't have to use individual buttons . Speaker project manager: one thing with the scroll buttons though . we would have to have an L_C_D_ and the glow in the dark thing might be difficult . Speaker industrial designer: , also we've got the integrated pushbutton , which is what we're most familiar with .  My personal preferences ? I think we could go for the kinetic energy source . It's not been seen before , so it could be quite a , a novelty factor , And also energy saving 'cause you're producing the energy , you don't need an external sort of battery supply or solar panels . Rubber casing I thing would probably the best , if we're going for the anti-R_S_I_ and like more choice with aesthetics . And probably the regular chip as opposed to the simple , Maybe if the , , if it was just kind of a , more of a rubber coating which was on to a case . So , it was kind of , the whole thing would be removable . you can get sort of outer casing for iPods and something , that's just  it's protective as well .

Speaker industrial designer: We've been quite successful with the rubber coating Speaker project manager: The look is a little bit more playful . Speaker marketing expert: Yeah I guess that depends on your definition of fancy , Speaker industrial designer: I mean  th the colours we were given for making the prototype aren't the colours that I think we would've necessarily chosen . I mean diff if you can visualise this in nice colours I think it would look quite fancy .  Speaker marketing expert: I kinda  I like the potato look . It's a two ? Okay so question number two was  is it techn technologically innovative ? So I know we have the kinetic energy which is very innovative . Speaker industrial designer: and the use of the rubber . and we don't have any scroll buttons , it's all pushbuttons , there's no L_C_D_ control , so if we're thinking about the rest of the market , it's sort of probably halfway . Speaker marketing expert: we didn't want it to be any more innovative than this , because then that would've defeated the purpose . we'll put three , but I think we actually reached our goal . , will it be easy to use ? Speaker project manager: Yeah . One . Speaker marketing expert: you can't really get confused with that . Speaker project manager: The plus number thing . Speaker marketing expert: But once that's figured out , it should be fine . Is this a good-looking remote ? Speaker industrial designer: Again I think the colour comes into this .

Speaker marketing expert: the bottom could be like ch chopped a bit . Speaker user interface: But then it wouldn't sit as comfortably in your hand  . Speaker marketing expert: Would we wanna show it off to our friends ?  Okay , so should we say two for that ? will people be willing to spend twenty five Euros on this product ? Speaker user interface: I think we have to market it in the right way , that  to say that it is simplistic . And the kinetic energy part . Speaker marketing expert: No , I guess , I don't know much about the remote control industry , how much your average sells for , Speaker user interface: About ten pounds .

Speaker industrial designer: But I mean it's not obviously obvious from the outside that that's gonna happen 'cause you can't s particularly see an alarm . Speaker project manager: I thought the light from the inside was gonna light up . You press the button it makes a noise Speaker user interface: It would just be a little speaker on the back or something . Speaker marketing expert: We can give it a one , because compared to every other remote ever m ever made , this one will be easier to find . Will it be easy to learn how to use this remote when brand new ? it's eas they'll pick it up and they'll know what to do . The plus thing needs to be worked on . we'll say yes it's one ? , will it minimise the effects of R_S_I_ , Speaker project manager: I think so . Speaker industrial designer: We may have to do some more research into other strain injuries that we don't know about . Speaker marketing expert: Two okay . Did we somehow incorporate the company colour and logo ? Speaker project manager: Well , yeah the colours are yellow and grey . So it could be grey on the banana one .

Speaker user interface: I suppose you c try make it a universal remote But , you know , they all sorta have the same role changing channels , volumes and then programming . I think they all work on the same prin principle as well one thing I thought of with the remote control is you always lose 'em . So if there's a g a way of finding it quite easily , I thought that'd be quite good quite a good feature . Speaker project manager: So we should we should set our remote control up to where it has a like a tracking device Speaker user interface: you could whistle or make a noise Speaker project manager: there's a button on the T_V_ that you press Speaker user interface: and it'd beep . Generally , all remotes are sort of quite similar in their appearance . Speaker project manager: so they're kinda like long and rectangular . Do we want something crazy ? we want something new that's gonna stand out . Speaker user interface: Maybe sorta spherical or something . A ball . Speaker marketing expert: Maybe like user-friendly , where you can use both hands , like a little keyboard type thing . Speaker user interface: I thought maybe , because people always tend to throw a remote control about the place to one another  and maybe the actual controls are inside or something . Speaker industrial designer: you can't have it be any form and fulfil all functions at the same time , so there are always the  some restrictions however one question is how stable is that thing supposed to be , How sturdy is it gonna be ?

Speaker industrial designer:  the ball is a nice idea because of it's stability really , Also also you risk the hinges here . That's that's a problem . so we'd have to have it flat on one side at least , down here somewhere , but that's of course a weak point , yeah . Speaker project manager: I mean would we just have a flat spot on the bottom of the ball ? Speaker industrial designer: The shape is perhaps not the most ideal . there must be a compromise between stability and design here , so . Speaker user interface: I can't think of anything other than a long rectangle for remote , Speaker project manager: it's not innovative , everybody does long remote Speaker marketing expert: My idea was just to have it be kind of like a keyboard type shape , you know , like video games We could also try to do the hinge thing , so it could like flip out that way . Speaker user interface: but something that would maybe fit in the hand easier . I mean maybe design something , that's sort of like  Speaker project manager: So perhaps the the joystick  the the keyboard idea might work better . Because even  I suppose even with the ball Speaker user interface: it still not the ho easiest thing to hold , yeah . I think it's definitely got to be a a one-handed a one-handed job . Speaker industrial designer: if it's small it probably looks better , may not be th as functional . Speaker project manager: say we went with the ball the ball function , but maybe we give it sort of grips along the side s to make it easier to hold on to . But if we're gonna make it flat on the bottom , then that eliminates our ball anyways . And then we have the problem with the hinge . Speaker industrial designer: The question is also , I dunno , d do you really always want to open that thing when you have to use it ? Speaker project manager: so then we forget the ball . So we've got our sort of keyboard kind . Speaker industrial designer: Question is what makes those game pads functional ? I think that's pretty much the form for full hand . So it's a round shape underneath that makes it comfy , Except for that I think we'll not  probably not get a get away from some longer design . and  Batteries go weak as well , Speaker project manager: Is it possible to have it to where it would work with a like a sensor on either side ? So that either way you're pointing it it would work . Speaker industrial designer: O of course the more technology you stick in that , the more it'll cost , so . but it's rather about an instinctual thing , Otherwise the design of  or the the point of putting two sensors on both sides would probably work .",

And so I will show you some of the results from that , They said that the users dislike the look and feel of their current remote controls . And seventy five percent of the users find their remote controls to be ugly . And eighty percent of the users would be willing to spend more money if they could get a remote that would look fancy . I think that's definitely important . Seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot . And if anyone could clarify what that means ? Zap , does that just mean like changing the channel ? and fifty percent of the users say that they're only using ten percent of the buttons on their remote control . they kept track of the frequency per hour in using certain buttons . And some of them it looks like barely need to be included at all . Of course channel selection is used the most frequently . And then teletext was the next . Volume and then power . And then audio settings and screen settings and channel settings were practically never used . I think we could definitely eliminate or somehow combine a lot of the functions into one button . the biggest user frustrations , as we said fifty percent of people find that their remotes are lost somewhere , and so I think a tracking device of some sort would be a good idea . thirty four percent said it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote .

From the fifteen to twenty five age group over ninety percent said they would pay more . And it kind of just went down incrementally . so maybe we could discuss this and decide if we think it's worth investing in this . At least if we're targeting the younger groups . in conclusion . Some things that I drew from this are that I think we were correct . We definitely need to focus on a new modern appearance , since so many people seem to be concerned about the ugliness of their remote control . a multifunctional remote could be a good thing to explore . we need to simplify the remote and reduce the number of buttons , get rid of the ones that don't seem to be serving much purpose .

I'm just gonna yeah approach the technical functions design .  the method I used was to explore the technical functions of a remote control . And t s simplest approach that I came to is is to change , programme and operate an electronic device remotely . I had some things sent to me . Not very much . To look at similar devices . we discussed a universal one . But I think a universal remote control is actually quite a difficult object to design , and po possibly within maybe the budget that we do it , because you'd need to know all the spef specifications of a all the like electronic companies . You have to set them , reset them to everything . and that would only add buttons . Whereas I think the aim is to take away buttons . So I think it'd be better maybe to concentrate on maybe just a universal one for T_V_s . here here's just two pictures of remote controls . But one is user-centred . And you can straight away see there's less buttons . And the other one is  engineer-centred where that's more specified for the sort of the elaborate piece of equipment it's trying to control  and on what the  have said and the market research and stuff  probably looking at something that should be user-centred . Fewer buttons , simpler to use , maybe the other fifty percent , the buttons that are used very rarely like programming , they could be hidden maybe some remote controls you might have come across have maybe a little flip thi thing where they're hidden away . the major findings  market researchers have said , it's the image and the appearance that people di dislike .

        "text": "Speaker industrial designer: Gonna talk to you about the working design of the interiors basically which is what dictates the design the both the interface basically and the outer appearance I'm going to do a lot of the stuff on the board . This is the basic basic premise of a remote control . the basic function is to send messages to another system . An energy source feeds an integrated circuit , like a chip , there's also some sound systems but infrared is the better or the more more used system . that can compose messages .  Often in the form of infrared bits . A user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages . what we have is different components that obviously need to go in there . We'll start with an energy source . which is usually a battery This energy source of course is connected to the the user interface itself  . which can be buttons , whatever , which in fact controls a chip . the way this goes normally is that this chip then controls an infrared lamp . And  Of course that's controlled , the chip itself is controlled by the user interface . The way you normally normally do it is that you add a little device such as a lamp to the whole thing as well , so that you know that it's working basically . The the energy source for one thing can be altered . What we probably cannot alter is of course the infrared , the sending device basically , the infrared lamp . as we've heard speech recognition is the hype obviously in the moment .  The user interface . That's something we can also discuss . We cannot change the chip Or if we just do the usual button thing . Or we have a touch pad or something like that  And of course the energy source . Batteries . Solar cells . Of course it's always a question whether these these components are in fact  available cheap enough , developed enough . Speaker project manager: the more complex we make it of course , the more expensive  younger generations of people have said that they would pay more for a speech recognition remote . possibly it might be worth the investment . Speaker user interface: I think speech recognition was one of those things where they have to be really good for them to work . 'Cause sometimes you find yourself just saying things over and o  if it's on your phone . And you need to sort of take into light languages and then  different dialects I suppose as well . Speaker project manager: I  myself I find , when you , h when there's something like spee speech recognition . Like you call on the phone and you try to change your telephone or power or something . Sometimes they have a a speech recognition on the other end , and you find yours , like you said , saying the same thing over and over and over . Speaker marketing expert: Another thing about these figures is ninety one percent of the youngest age groups said they'd do it , but probably a lot of them that's actually their parents money . I don't know if they would actually go out and purchase this themselves , a fifteen year old you know . Speaker project manager: It's a , it's a gimmick factor that they like at first ,",

        "text": "Speaker project manager: from all all three of your presentations , I think that we were on the right track a lot in our last meeting . We want something that looks good . we want something that's simple . We want something that you can find easily .  And the speech recognition I I guess is kind of give or take . probably , I would say , probably not worth the investment at this point in time . Speaker user interface: I did have have a thought about the sort of the tracking thing . if it came with maybe a holder or holster , whatever you wanna call it . But if you don't put it back in , you press something like a little button on that , and that just sort of sends out a beep  to find where it is or something . Just by infrared . Speaker project manager: That'd be , that'd be good if we were going with our our ball . Or or with  you know I guess with any form that that would be good . that could be the charger . we could use rechargeable batteries in the remote . However , however you wanted to go about it , the holder could also be the charging unit .  With the locator button . It looks like you're already on your way for working with the components . User interface concept , we want it to be something simple .  Minimal number of buttons . Speaker user interface: I do still think it needs to be something that is ultimately one-handed . The ball is probably not a good idea . Speaker project manager:  Shall we maybe shoot for a a specific target group ? if we were shooting for young guys then it's a certain look to the remote . Or girls or older people ? Speaker user interface: I don't know if that might cope with like the trend-watching . Speaker marketing expert: but maybe by the next meeting we'll have some info on that . Speaker project manager: we'll just say we've got a colour scheme for it . yellow it's nice and bright , with the buttons being grey or black . And our slogan pasted somewhere on it , on the the bottom maybe we could flare it or something . of course this will look like a bone then . Speaker user interface: it might be to look at sort of the the shape and trend of like things like mobile phones , and the shapes that the they've been going . Speaker project manager: mobile phones they've kind of taken a turn to where they're really small . which may defeat our purpose for being able to locate our remote all the time .  Maybe we could go with a square or something .  with minimal number of buttons . I guess you've got you know one through nine . For typing in your channels . you've got volume , up and down . Channel up and down . Speaker marketing expert: Power . Speaker project manager: a mute . A menu button , maybe . if we want the remote to do other things like  or I guess the T_V_ to be able to change the tint and the colour and you know all those kind of things that are built into T_V_s , we just have that under one standard menu button press the menu button , scroll up and down to select it . Speaker industrial designer: Talking of which maybe a scrolling function is not not too bad . Would probably be like a scrolling , little scrolling wheel like this . Speaker project manager: Like a wheel on your mouse . Speaker industrial designer: if we're coming from mice , we can even add a click function , where you , in order to verify the information you just press it down . Also when it comes to the ergonomics of the whole thing , if you wanna make it square for the looks of it , then maybe to make it more comfortable to hold the whole thing , you add a little bulge down here . Then you hold it in your hand like this . And maybe you bring the buttons nearer to the  or the imp more important buttons nearer to the to the side . Speaker user interface: the bigger ones you know they could actually be bigger in size than the ones that are less important , the smaller here . Speaker industrial designer: You can also have it , maybe , talking about mobile phones again , sliding open . Speaker user interface: on a sort of side view . Something that you know it would sort of fit in the hand better . Speaker industrial designer: causes a problem for left or right-handed people actually . So . Speaker user interface:  instantly sort of always going for the right-handed person . Speaker marketing expert: Maybe you could buy like a special left-handed version of the remote .  Special order . Speaker project manager: it should be probably designed for a right-handed p person . Speaker user interface: I mean I'm just just thinking maybe if it was circular with the sort of  that sort of   the sort of early idea we had , with the way that was more like that , Speaker industrial designer: If we have a smaller a smaller device that actually fits into the big one . . Then there's maybe another point of making it a two-in-one kind of thing . and just a couple of functions in there . Like your zap zapping device is just u channels up-down , volume , and on-off . You give it the full functions in here , Means the big one has to be sufficiently big . And perhaps heavy ,",

We are talking something more complicated of course , it's going to be more expensive as well . we are also restricted in the use of our outer shell , or in the material that we could use for our outer shell . So we what we can use is plastic , rubber , wood and titanium . Can also mix these . what we could use is , or what I was offered , or what we could use , is a basic bateer battery . So obviously I personally have to say that dynamo is out of the question really . solar cell is interesting .  May fail though , every here and there . the kinetic energy thing might work , but the same problem . You leave it lying around and you first have to shake it before it it starts to work . So I'd say what we're stuck with really is the basic battery . our interface options are push-buttons . however  when it comes to the scroll wheel of the iPod I've one big objection and that is that we have to fit an L_C_D_ into the remote control as well . If we have a more sophistic sophisticated scroll wheel rather than this very basic set-up that we that I've just presented , the chip has to be more s more sophisticated and thus more expensive as well . solar cells cannot be used on a curved or latex surface or remote control . With the titanium we cannot make it a curved design . With plastic , as I understand it , you can use any form .  With rubber we could sh pretty much shape it the way we wanted it , but we cannot add scroll wheels , and we cannot add an L_C_D_ screen .",

Speaker marketing expert: I've just been presented with some research we've done in a small focus group a hundred people , just asked them about their remote control usage habits and what they want in a remote control . . I've just got a web page with some data on it . basically it's saying that users generally dislike the look and feel of their remote controls . seventy five u seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . . Eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . . Current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user . seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot , . Fifty percent of users say that they only use ten percent of the buttons , so they've got a remote control with a lot of functionality but really most of the time they only use a small part of that . Speaker project manager: Do you Do you have this information on the web page you said ? Speaker marketing expert: I have an a web page yes . Speaker project manager: mayb maybe you can can send an email to me later . about this . Speaker marketing expert: there's a breakdown of how much they use the different functions on a rem remote control . , power and volume selection are only used a few times within this per hour . , channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times  and then there's things like channel settings , audio settings , which are only used very infrequently . . Teletext is used fourteen times in the hour , so it is used but not nearly as much as the channel selection is used . . An interesting thing that this report has brought up is that fifty fifty percent of users report that the remote control gets lost a lot of the time in the room , so some way of some way of locating the remote control would be very useful to a lot of users . . Thirty four percent said it takes too long to learn to use a remote control , they want something that's easier to use straight away , more intuitive perhaps . . And thirty  twenty six percent said remote controls are bad for R_S_I_ . I don't know how we'd go about combating that . and then it's got a demographic breakdown Speaker industrial designer: Maybe y y you cannot put this webpage online on the  Speaker marketing expert: I should be able to actually , if I email it to you now . Speaker industrial designer: these numbers have have to be have to be taken into account for the both yeah user interface and functional design . and we need to select to to constraint our design based on what is more important . Speaker marketing expert: , one thing is interesting is talking about speech recognition in a remote control . And who would pay more for that and whether people would find it useful . Speaker industrial designer: it would be all based on speech . Interesting idea . Speaker marketing expert: I think that would not work so well . You wanna have both options . Speaker project manager: it would it would be a solution for when your remote control is lost , I mean when it has speech recognition then i then it doesn't matter where it is , my  well it's  we should be in range , or maybe it can respond and produce sound , so say where it is . I'm not sure whether we will we can make this for  for twelve Euro fi and fifty cents  . Speaker industrial designer: And we don't know where the state of the art of speech recognition is , Speaker user interface: there is it's a very small vocabulary that you want to do the operations like you want to say on , off , one , two , twenty three , Speaker industrial designer: But it's quite noisy if there is the T_V_ shouting . Speaker marketing expert: This is now talking about who would pay for speech recognition in a remote control , who would pay more for it , . Ninety percent of the fifteen to twenty five year old market said that they would pay more , seventy six percent for twenty five to thirty five , thirty five percent for thirty five to forty five , twenty two percent for forty five to fifty five and then eight percent for fifty five to sixty five . it really depends where we're gonna be targeting this product , , which we'll be talking about later I think .

And in this presentation this group presentation  is gonna focus on the working design of the the remote control . I'd like first to give a quick a very simple introduction , how does it work , the basic function of a remote control is to send messages to another system that is fixed . an energy source feeds an integrated circuit , the chip , that can compose messages , usually through a infrared bit and the user interface controls the chip and accordingly the the messages , the main point is that I would wish to to make a really functional product . I would prefer to have very functional capabilities rather than fancy stuff that in fact is not used and doesn't work . as it's important to take into account the user requirements from the Marketing Expert Anna we want an on off button , it's simple but it's it's important , and also  the to both channels as well as other buttons that come after , the components I quickly draw here , in this part you have the remote control the the sender and on the other part the receiver my aim would be to design the and choose the chips and the infrared components to build the remote control of course we need energy sources and the receiver a a receiver . what I have found and  after a lot of work actually I  I draw this I draw for you this schema    And that's it so I won't go into details about that but these are my preferences to use that kind of components . Speaker project manager:  And and why do you want these kind of component ? I mean , are they cheap , or are they reliable ? Speaker industrial designer: and yeah th you have always a compromise with reliability and i if it's expensive , this one also really reliable that's it for the working design , Speaker project manager: What I w what I was thinking about the the the schema about the sender and the receiver , can you can you get back to it ? the receiver is of course already in the television So we we must adapt to the to the receiver . I I suppose there is a standard way of communicating to televisions . Speaker industrial designer: We will use  infrared protocol using  yeah infrared and of course we need to adapt to that protocol that already exists but we what we can do is adapting  the the chips inside to the best chips and infrared bubbles . Speaker user interface: it's just you had to change the frequencies .  But you should be careful , like a guy has recently designed a remote which could switch off any other T_V_s  , so basically  through all the things .

Speaker user interface: you can have a key which could tell y it could go to the video thing in that case when it you use that the function should be able to take up the V_C_R_ option in in few ye coming years you might even have a system where you have a separate sitting setup box suppose you are not able to watch some programme and actually it downloading all the time for you when you come back you could just switch on that thing and watch a program .

Speaker user interface: you you you can have keys like which are which are like so . so we basically don't change the original order of them so the keys can be it looks you know not very much cluttered Speaker project manager: we should now try to decide on our target group . Speaker marketing expert: , basically we're trying to get people to buy a remote control   wouldn't they already have a remote control with their television when they buy one ? Speaker project manager: So our our our remote control has to be better . Speaker marketing expert: 'cause it's only a low market , it's a cheap-end remote control , we might  we'll be able to  beat them on th the look of it , th the design of it they're not just going to buy a new remote control just 'cause it looks pretty , they have to actually need it as well . Speaker project manager: I think  many people said in your in in your research the appearance of the R_C_ is is important when they are buying one Speaker marketing expert: . But if people are buying a new remote control for functionality they'll buy a universal remote . I've got friends who've got so many things they need a universal remote , Speaker project manager: So your you think we should go for a more u universal high-performance  Speaker marketing expert: We We're not building a universal remote , we're not building a high end product . Speaker industrial designer: we have yeah twelve point five Euros per per R_ s R_C_ now you know that chips are very cheaps and we can include it in our control some new new features .

Speaker project manager: I don't know . I don't know whether that's necessary . because universal remote controls tend to be quite expensive . S so we can try to go in between , and offer a product which is not as expensive and not as complicated because it has more it it is in some kind universal .

Are we gonna be at the very bottom of the price range , Speaker project manager: when we think it over I thi I think we are trying to offer the a kind of universal control for for less money . Speaker user interface: Well  Well I it's fine with me like the price as long as it is not too expensive . Speaker industrial designer: because we have to take into account that we are gonna b we are gonna sell four aro around four million Speaker project manager: then we we decide on on on going to this more universal kind of control .

So what I have found was that currently the  they are mostly that the T_V_ , V_C_R_ , music system operated ones actually , for example if you want to follow the V_C_R_ and if you want to follow the g s some soundtrack on the w w see they have the common thing actually you can have like the remote with L_C_D_ display for browsing because you have multiple functionalities for example you are watching a movie , and you are  having a universal remote control and you want to you don't know really which functionality is  now , for example I can use a simple toggle switch , and a display , so I press it so the display says , okay , I'm in T_V_ or D_V_D_ or whatever it is , instead of having three keys separately for four keys , there can be children friendly where you can programme your remote so that they they are not allowed to browse certain channels which you can block them , and you can operate them . and maybe having something like a blinking thing , like it could indicate you're  it it could indicate what is cal like the whether you you have enough battery in your in your remote , the blinking .

Speaker industrial designer: And isn't that too difficult I don't know if we still want the R_C_ to be easy to use , Speaker user interface: it d depends on the easiness like the user how much effort he can put .

Speaker user interface: because as more and more channels come then you have more and more problems to remember the v v exact channel numbers ex exactly , There is also a speech recognition to store channel information , names , if you have a multiple functionality , say T_V_ , V_C_R_ or something I say it to the T_V_ and the  T_V_ , and you can programme the keys if you want to , certain keys are even the channel information  . In the present market I saw it that says something like they are looking for  eighty word thing , eighty word , which shouldn't be th that difficult to implement , like eighty to hundred word . Basically you want you don't want to store all the channels in the remote control , you want to st store your favourite channel . Speaker marketing expert: Maybe ten channels , yeah at the most . Speaker user interface: I personally would look at  things like having a u universal remote , instead of having  unusual ones for all of them you can think of having , with multiple functionality possibly with speech recognition . I got a mail from the the coffee machine interface unit that they have integrated the s speech recognition into a into the coffee machine , and so if you say hello coffee machine , it say hi Joe , or something like that , Speaker marketing expert: But a coffee machine , there's not too many words they'd be using with that it's a it's a small vocabulary . Speaker user interface: so it's a limited vocabulary thing , and very isolated word and it's it is interesting , and basically storing the channel through voice or other ways of programming your keys , on the display for the browsing",

I think  for our design we want some b programmable you know V_ V_L_S_I_ or F_P_G_A_ high technology , and also we'll use yeah like in any high-tech devices a chip of fi fibreglass to  them and connect them . my personal design  we need to find a solution what what is the material of the cover we want to use . If it's plastic Speaker project manager: m m maybe m maybe we can give the the the case a very normal a v very normal case but , with the changeable covers to fancy it up . So like a normal cheap plastic case which can be covered up in , for instance , a wooden case . Speaker industrial designer: they also emailed me that they have  available a bunch of different buttons , a scroll wheels , integrated push buttons s such as a  computer mouse . And very cheap L_C_D_s , so liquid crystal displays , so I'm wondering , I think we might be able to integrate L_C_D_ into our R_C_ . And the final point okay is we have  yeah there are some compromise to to do . we have to know that the push button requires a simple chip , but the scroll wheel and that kind of higher high-tech stuff needs more money which is a higher price range And the display requires an advanced chip , which in turns is more expensive than the regular chip , but  I think with twelve Euros and if it's made for four million items , then I think w we could be able to handle that . And for the designing of the cove cover layout then it's better to to to maybe see that with the the U_R_ exp U_R_I_ Expert so that we can  it's really a team-working Speaker user interface: for example I wanted to know like if you want to have a a fo if you want to have the L_C_D_ display over there , or if you want to store a programmes with a keys  Speaker industrial designer: it's kind of simple  pro progra programmable device , and we have to insert . I think we could insert one that could underlie several functions Speaker user interface: How f cost effective it would be to put that car chip into it and do the programmable things . Speaker project manager: I think we we should come to some decisions now a about this . I understand when we want a display we need a expensive chip , but when we want a scrolling wheel w we also need the expensive chip , so can we use same chip , so with one expensive chip we can implement several complicated or advanced features . Speaker industrial designer: Exactly yeah that's a very good idea , Speaker project manager: when the more expensive chip you mentioned there is is possible in the in the given budget , maybe we should go for for the more expensive chip , Speaker user interface: I don't know if it'll fit into our cost of twelve point five Euro you know . Speaker industrial designer: I think both  if we had a budget of twenty twenty Euros , it will be okay , Speaker marketing expert: maybe we need specific costings then . do maybe two designs and then cost them out and see which one is gonna fit in our budget better . Speaker project manager: wh when you make a  a design ca you can   next meeting you can give an quite an exact cost price . Speaker user interface: like what will be the each individually the cost of it .  'cause it's  I think it's m much easier to use a plastic or a rubber  rather than wood . It will be much ch much expensive Speaker project manager: I think I think we can just use more cheap plastic for a kind of basic edition , Speaker industrial designer: but i it's a detailed yeah yeah plastic versus wood , and we need maybe to centre our description on the the really the what buttons what functionality we want to offer to the user , and maybe with  graphs or I don't know   Speaker project manager: We now can concentrate on the on the basic remote control . Speaker user interface: We can give them smooth keys , The the problem most of the time we've seen , the keys is that it's small , for example , as I was  if you make them big , it may change the look of the thing also to the people . Speaker industrial designer: and not too m too many keys of course yeah . Speaker marketing expert: one I've had before , a r r remote control we have at home is one that's actually got a cover on the bottom so the bottom bit is just , covers half the keys most of the time , Speaker project manager: So maybe it's possible , I don't know whether you can can indicate this , that you can elsewhere open your remote control and on the inside are buttons you don't use that much . Speaker marketing expert: can we think about maybe having a a non-recta non non-rectangular one , so with not just the straight little box Speaker industrial designer: maybe we need to also to make a decision on how how how big we want to be and how many buttons like n we should  dec decide numbers or ",

Speaker project manager: and also the evaluation criteria , so what what is important to look at . Speaker marketing expert: it's just a shortlist of criteria on the things that we've identified as being important to selling the product . we just go through these and rate them as a group and then at the end we'll make an evaluation based on that ,  These are the things we identified as being important .  the three things were look and feel , innovation and ease of use , were the three important components appealing to the correct demographic so using those things in the right way to appeal to our demographic . And then goin following the company motto , following the fashion trends and putting that into the product as well . do you wanna go through and put through those on the the two products now or do we wanna discuss them further and then evaluate them ? Speaker project manager: why not why not discuss discuss it now ,   Speaker marketing expert: just go through onto the whiteboard I guess . look and feel , innovation   Speaker user interface: And now it  easy to use . Speaker marketing expert: you following the idea of using the removable covers on these ? Speaker project manager: w w we can still discuss that . and together with evaluating this we we might come with new ideas I've received a framework which we can do this . this is these are the the the latest prices of our production production unit for several components , so we can see whether the the price is is within the twelve Euro fifty cents . Th th this is the first design . Speaker marketing expert: w  one's bad and seven's the best . one's true and seven's false . Speaker project manager: Look and feel . In i in my opinion purely feel is is is very good , is very good in your hand , so I I I would consider two or or may maybe even one for feel . we should also consider look , and then i it looks quite conventional . Speaker marketing expert: On the scale u it's between functional and fancy basically we're looking at , Speaker project manager: Ma ma ma ma maybe say say five Speaker user interface: but still I will give four in that case the way we have designed it's like the surf as you say  Speaker marketing expert: And the other one ? I think it's slightly better , , Speaker user interface: which which 'll be covering in a curve  actually this is this is not going to protrude actually , Speaker marketing expert: The other thing is , is the left hand one protruding ? 'Cause if people are left handed they want to use the other hand , maybe it won't work so well . I'd say two or three for that one , personally . Speaker project manager: So so  I would also say this is four . Speaker user interface: because right for example if you press it quite inside now like this , now it's embedded one . Speaker industrial designer: So I will say two . Speaker marketing expert: it's d it's definitely more fancier than that one . Speaker industrial designer: Basically there is no innovation in the first one compared to what exists in the market , Speaker user interface: No but except for the design of the surf  . Speaker marketing expert: Are we including like a location kind of thing like trying to find it ? Speaker user interface: I think it's more of the feel . Speaker marketing expert: But th is there any there's no actual innovation in that at all , Speaker industrial designer: And the  And the second one is really state of the art , in terms of innovation . Speaker marketing expert: So I'd be up for seven for innovation . Speaker industrial designer: And with many more functionalities , and can open and close the the bottom part . And all the scrolling buttons and menu and pro programmable device behind this . Speaker project manager: A and the L_C_D_ screen is  That's that's that's well it's quite innovative . Speaker industrial designer: could put it at one or two I would say . Personally . Speaker marketing expert: Th th there were different options we discussed then , we discussed the one that was in budget and the one that was out of budget . Speaker project manager: and then we will will try to get it in the budget . We just diske discuss it as you designed it Speaker marketing expert: Innovation for this one is two ? One ? the speech recognition is a very good innovation I believe it , Speaker project manager:  then it's I think one . Speaker marketing expert: Ease of use ? Speaker industrial designer: the first one is really standard , so everybody i including our grandmothers can use it , Speaker marketing expert: So that's maybe a a two for ease of use . Speaker industrial designer: , the other one is quite easy , tho though . Speaker user interface: , though it has more functionality Speaker marketing expert: So maybe a three or a four . Speaker industrial designer: maybe sometimes people get scared with the number of buttons . because it's n it's not like a big one with one hundred buttons or so ,   Speaker user interface: actually the user has to put some effort to do  use that actually , Speaker project manager: So so I think th three is good . Yeah . Speaker marketing expert: how well it goes to the target demographic . we're d we're still thinking twenty to forty year olds ? Speaker user interface: I would I would give this model to the old people actually . Speaker marketing expert: So sh completely changed our demographic there , Speaker project manager: exce except for the surfing shape . I mean that's that's something which which has an appeal on this group I think , Speaker marketing expert: If it was the very bottom price range or it was like between this and another one we did the same thing then I can imagine it being  applying to the the demographic Speaker project manager: w w w we  after this we can can consider for instance , making this more attractive to to the demographic Speaker marketing expert: 'Cause we have got room , we've got some budget there to add a few things to it , Speaker project manager: But as it is now , I w would say , six , something . Speaker industrial designer: because it's so important  it's i it was written that it really so important , the the the look and taking care of its  it targets , the right range of people , Speaker user interface: but but if you sell it in the market it's going to be cheap , actually . Speaker industrial designer:  we have a constraint that we need to sell at twenty five Euros . Speaker marketing expert: There's nothing that would make me spend an extra k few Euros on that one rather than another one . Speaker user interface: So in that case well it's fine then . Speaker marketing expert: and the demokraphi demographic of the second one ? It's got the got the the toys in it , it's got the L_C_D_ screen Speaker industrial designer: if we we wish to to sell four millions of this , I think for this audience we need absolutely the L_C_D_ screen . Speaker marketing expert: I think especially if we're gonna n have an L_C_D_ screen on a low range product then that's good . I'd probably go with three again for that one . Speaker industrial designer: Or even  Even one and two . Or two . Speaker user interface: Yeah two yeah . because you can add  lot of sophistication on that . Speaker marketing expert: And especially I guess 'cause this has the speech recognition as well , and that makes it more appealing , Speaker project manager: the final point , trends . Speaker marketing expert: the trends were the fruit and vegetables and the spongy feel . as it is , not really doing either of them . Speaker industrial designer: Spongy , , that means that it goes in in the water .  Speaker marketing expert: the spongy could be part of the the feel of the buttons as well , have you tried the mobile phones that have got the kinda spongy buttons that feels kinda spongy . but I'm thinking one of the Nokias that's got like you ca it hasn't got individual buttons Speaker user interface: Yeah . We we we we we yeah , it's the way they are going to be , actually . Speaker industrial designer: the maybe in the colour we can make it fruit and and veggie . Speaker marketing expert: But that's if you're using the covers . Speaker project manager: is it possible do you think , to to make a cover for s such a phone ? Speaker marketing expert: they make it for mobiles , it can't be that much more complicated . Speaker project manager: just with the with the flexible plastic  Speaker marketing expert: So you got the option of having different colours or different textures . Speaker user interface: Yeah I think yeah it should be possible like what we do with the mobile phone , yeah . Speaker project manager: we can put the the  the fancy f look of vegetables for instance , to to these covers Speaker marketing expert: I think the  if we do the cover that's really going with the company's philosophy of having the fashion in in electronics , even next year when fruit and vegetables might be out , you'll still be able to put a new cover on it Speaker industrial designer: look at this computer , th this laptop , it's all black , and it's quite conventional , and sometimes people don't like too much flashy colours like this one presented here . So maybe we could do like in the range the set of what we propose a black one , very standard one , that meets the the requirements of th such people that want really standard things . Speaker marketing expert: And then you have the option of having the different colours , different covers . Although it is more with the spongy buttons on the on the other one . 'Cause that's the that's the feature that could be included in either of them . Speaker project manager: Say , say one and two . One and two . Speaker marketing expert: the average of that is three six nine divided by five , so five  nine by five , one point s eight ? Speaker user interface: One point eight yeah . Four point  four point two . Speaker industrial designer: Very good . Speaker marketing expert: But we still got a very different price for those two so they're not really comparable yet anyway .",

Speaker project manager: what kind of energy source It's a  it's a normal battery , or  Speaker user interface: maybe you might use a A_A_ battery actually . Speaker project manager:  given speech recognition I think w you should go for the less fancy chip . Speaker industrial designer: sample speaker , yeah . Speaker project manager: Double curve . , plastic would be the material . Speaker user interface: Are you talking about this or that ?

Speaker marketing expert: And that's without any special button supplements . we'd have a special colour , special form and special material on all of them . Speaker industrial designer: it's not it's not double curved , it's single curved , Speaker marketing expert: it's like it's curved on the sides and curved on the top and bottom as well , that's what I thought . we've got those  the scroll wheel on the side Speaker project manager: I'm I'm no I'm no I'm not sh sure .

Speaker project manager: We  We could go for the for the for the for the for a simple chip , but then we can't have the the speech recognition , this would this would be cutting the speech recognition . Speaker industrial designer: but if you have the  near the L_C_D_ you can  choose  select between you know like uni universal between audio , T_V_ and V_C_R_ , and this needs a needs a advanced chip . I think yeah regular , today we you can do that with regular chip . Speaker project manager: and we still on fifteen , Speaker industrial designer: And what about the number of buttons buttons   my Matthew ? Speaker project manager: when we just want to to cut the number of buttons we have to make seven to to fit in in twelve twelve fifty . Speaker marketing expert:  But that's seven basic buttons right , seven buttons without any adds-on , without special colours or form or material . the L_C_D_ display is is three Francs , sorry three Euros , by itself . Speaker industrial designer: We we really want a L_C_D_ other otherwise we w wouldn not get the market . Speaker marketing expert: So we're gonna have to scale this down to get within budget , Speaker industrial designer: So wha what what each of us think about the  because it's measure point the L_C_D_ ,  Speaker user interface: Or we could even replace them by buttons actually . Speaker industrial designer: Because sometimes whe when you watch the T_V_ in fact , you have a big display Speaker user interface: A actually it depends , it depends what kind of functionalities you want to add into it , for example if you add two more functionalities then better you add two more buttons , or  and you'll have L_C_D_ display which is  that is going to bring the cost by two two Euros at least . Speaker marketing expert: I think , unless we can really drive these prices down we need to get rid of the L_C_D_ display . Speaker user interface: Okay so we can get rid of it and then add a couple of buttons . Speaker marketing expert: and it's looking like we can't afford the L_C_D_ display , there's no way we can get it in there . Speaker project manager:  S so who thinks the the L_C_D_ disply display should be i should be in it ? Speaker marketing expert: I th I'd like t it to be in but I can't see it happening . I can't see it fitting in . Speaker project manager: having an L_C_D_ s display is just have very very limited amount of buttons . So hav hav having seven buttons , instead of twelve . Speaker industrial designer: actually we could in fact we move these three buttons and have three possibilities for each of the three here . Here one , at the middle , and at the bottom . Speaker project manager: I I think we should we should cut the L_C_D_ screen . That that's that's my opinion . Speaker industrial designer: The speech recognition is out . Because of the budget , yeah . Speaker marketing expert: are we basically back to the original one now , back to the first version ?",

And then we will discuss if we have few ideas and we will end by dispatching the different task you will be  you will have to fulfil to complete this process . So the the goal is to have a remote control so to have an advantage over our competitors we have to be original , we have to be trendy and we have to also try to be user-friendly . So the design step will be divided in three main points . First it will be the functional design . Third is the conceptual design and then is the desired design . So the functional design is to identify the main user needs , the technical function the remote control should fulfil . And then we will move to f conceptual design where we'll specify the different component involved , what kind of user interf interface we want and what are the different trend in user interface and stuff like that .

Speaker project manager: but but we are sort of being dictated that this should only be for the television . So we're quite fixed . So we're really probably , in terms of marketing , are looking for that's that's a cost winner rather than a fantastic new feature product . Speaker industrial designer: So we're gonna be removing the teletext out of any T_V_ that we  people use our remote with . So it's kind of a stupid decision . Speaker project manager: we really have to innovate here I guess . Speaker marketing expert: 'Cause we're talking about  eighty percent or ninety percent or ninety-five percent of the televisions out there are are teletext . 'cause somebody , some people are gonna be hap unhappy 'cause it took  they can't ac access their teletext . It's just when we eliminate that then what do we bring ? Speaker project manager: I think that the  last point is probably quite straightforward . Obviously the the  w it has to be branded . Speaker industrial designer: So then the double R_ will be our our  Speaker project manager: Can you handle that black and yellow ? Speaker user interface: I think w , yeah , one of the things that we should also keep in mind when we're doing this  I mean our company's slogan is we put the fashion in electronics , right . So I think our kind of  our target here is to  have some kind of very like sleek  nice look remote but I think one of the main selling points is that we don't want it to be clunky like like this thing here . We want something that looks nice and it's fashionable and so ",

We need some kinda of power d power source . we have to decide on our our user interface , which is his department , but the in user interface is also a major component . we need a programmable digital signal processor to to take the input from the user and translate that into into electronic signal , which we pass to the infra-red L_E_D_ , which you aim at the television which  and it receives that signal . You need a on-off switch And we also need to have the   if we want a universal remote we need to have encryption codes for the different makes of T_V_s . So we need to know all the different you know all the different signals and so that'll require some memory as well . so here's just a basic layout of how how the remote would work . You ha the v the power source is in the upper right-hand corner there , and you can see that we have the user interface here which is connected to the chip which does all our signal processing , and then passes that signal on to the infra-red L_E_D_ and that signal is then emitted and received by the television at the photo-transistor . Speaker marketing expert: We're talking about existing technology . Speaker user interface: this is just  this is just a basic layout of ev  of all the components that w w are gonna be absolutely necessary f to have a working remote . We can add things in like if we wanted some voice recognition , I mean that  I mean  that you can kinda say would  would fall under the user interface and the digital signal processing chip . Speaker project manager: Do we have an idea of costs of different components ? Speaker user interface: well the most the most costly components are gonna be the chip basically the user interface and the casing are gonna be expensive as well . the L_E_D_ and the the transistors and everything else are you know they're they're pretty cheap . We we have to wait until we get to a more specific design phase for that . but  and I think a significant part of the cost could be the actual the actual casing itself and and you know the the b the buttons and things like that , I think .

There's no need to have that in the remote . as for what I would recommend for the the interface design , and I will change the colours on the on the logo , but  we should go for the user-oriented device , so simple controls and good ergonomics . and although I th I th I'm still here recommending the teletext so I'll remove that , I guess ,",

Speaker industrial designer: and although I th I th I'm still here recommending the teletext so I'll remove that , I guess , Speaker project manager: So I I still think if it's cheap enough functionality-wise to include , it really should be in there . I mean  even if it's necessary or not , if you  if you're given the choice between a t a remote with teletext or without when it really  if it i  if it isn't more expensive for us to k make  because as far as I understand it ,  it can be operated with the same set of buttons , yeah ? Speaker user interface: i it's just  the cost of an extra button . Speaker marketing expert: I  in the very beginning it said with the with the advent of computers there's gonna be the  it's gonna be out-moded teletext . I I don't understand how those two things are connected . How does how does computers and teletext  h how  why is one eliminating the need of the other ? Speaker project manager: Well maybe what we're getting into here is the the idea of Internet through the T_V_ for example . Speaker industrial designer: the they're basically aiming at saying that  you would use  you know a couple of years ago teletext to be the easiest way to check like for the scheduling and the next programme and stuff like that But I still think teletext is way more convenient until until we have the same commodities . Speaker marketing expert: I just  I don't see the cross-over between computers and television . I mean I do see the cross-over in some sense , but but but but with the  the remote is is used for television , okay . Speaker project manager: Well there there is a  for example on digital T_V_ systems you have  you can press a button and you can buy things in adverts , They're just features from the Internet from computers are are coming into the T_V_ sort of under the covers , Yeah , and there's other features for example on other systems where you can pause live T_V_ and things like that . Speaker industrial designer: And all of those require the other commands with more complexity and more software and  Speaker project manager: If if it's  , for example , a trainable one then we're  just simply having like an up , down , left , right , an okay button or something like that might might do as well in future proofing it . Speaker industrial designer: but I guess we can remove it Speaker user interface: I think if it's possible you should try to you know have a talk with management about that . Speaker marketing expert: I I don't see the logic in elimination of teletext , Speaker project manager: Yeah , and neither do I in fact . a a and th the message really we wanna be sending to them is that , although teletext may become outdated w there's no l logic in not having it in there anyway i if it doesn't affect the price . Speaker industrial designer: but we're not putting some  there's no no putting anything in in the place of teletext . Speaker marketing expert: and and we're also  marketing a product . It's  what I'm seeing is a is a mid-range cost product . So so w we can't go and pump a whole bunch of technology into this thing Speaker project manager: So if we're keeping it basic we're loo loo what we're looking to sell it basically is it's just being very easy to use , looking exceptionally good , that sort of thing . Speaker marketing expert: and to me if I'm gonna market a product for b for beauty for for design I'm gonna I'm gonna try to market it at a much higher price . I want I want to market it as exclusive . So I would market this product it  at eighty-nine Euros and come up with some really  beautiful exterior design or something th but but I don't think we have that flexibility . Speaker project manager: But i if design if design is cheap and functionality is basic , then twenty-five Euros is probably a high price for a commoner garden  stan standard T_V_ Speaker marketing expert: and if I'm coming in with a with with twenty-five Euros , which is mid-market price , then what am I going to give these people for this ? Speaker industrial designer: just I I would I would advocate for continuing teletext and those would be the basic commands . Right now it's just the idea of simplicity and slickness , cute and small  as for , you know , the the case design maybe I'll come up with more concrete ideas . Speaker user interface: I'm just thinking you know with all these universal remotes that are out there , how many people  how many people actually use every feature you know i like these trainable remotes and things like that , where , you know , it's just so confusing to do  to use all these functions . They want something that looks nice , that you know that maybe it's it's ergonomic , it feels good in your hand , something like that . Where I think the largest portion of the market is just gonna  you know they lost their T_V_ remote , they need another one that'll work with their T_V_ . I think that's gonna be where you're gonna find the biggest , you know , market share . I think the more bells and whistles we add , it's just gonna cut into our into our profits . Because I think as we as we add costs for things like  for like if we add the voice recognition and things like that , I think  you know what percentage of the of the of the market is actually gonna use that ? Speaker project manager: But we can talk a little bit more potentially in the marketing marketing presentation about this . Speaker marketing expert: Oh P Pedro , I just want to say quickly I I would really like it when you can come up with some more bells and whistles , eh . You know sell  things come to my mind is something that's  voice-activated . 'Cause and I think of voice-activated I think of of  how many times I've I've lost my my remote and I can't find it . So some way that I can I can find my remote by clapping my hands or something our our competition out there has got these these multiple adaptors where they can use 'em for their V_C_R_s , their D_V_D_s , their  their televisions And so to me we have to make this a really special product but I I don't see the market niche for this product without without some really sort of something really special to identify it as as unique in the market . Speaker industrial designer: But we th that should be design . I think technology we'd we  we're not in the price range to do it . so we should we should aim at design . Speaker marketing expert: Okay well , so so that's up to you then Speaker project manager: Does any of the the features that Pedro's spoken about here have any implications we might not have thought about on in terms of just pure functionality ?

Right ?  Well maybe not a solar remote but instead what about if we had like a power cradle ? Like a a cradle that is is there to hold the remote when you're not using it , and we can , instead of having instead of having , you know , replaceable batteries we'll just have a power cell that stays there for the life of the remote . 'cause you have to put it back there to charge the remote , I I think it's a good opportunity for the user design  You know you could have some kind of neat little , you know ,  a sexy design for d a cradle and the remote itself . Speaker marketing expert: I like the idea , but we're talking about  in cost is gonna probably double . Speaker user interface: And you could page the remote if you lose it . Speaker project manager: Now the the question is can we make this for less than twelve-fifty per ? Speaker marketing expert: No no . No no , we have t we have to change the end cost . Speaker project manager: We we well do we necessarily have to change the end cost because  Can we dl can we do that without  changing it twelve-fifty per product , if we basically can sell more based on this ? Speaker marketing expert: I   my reaction is no , but Speaker user interface:  what I can do is I can d look into ho well Pedro and I can look into how much this might increase our our costs Speaker project manager: I w I don't wanna go over somewhere and put it down . It  i if it is gonna be somewhere that you put it down then it needs to be at the side of your armchair , and that implies that there's only one T_V_ user . Speaker user interface: it would last for several hours on its own power , but when you're done with it you put it back in the cradle . Speaker project manager: But it it takes away the ease of use of the remote to a certain extent . I d I d I d I think it it  in my mind it doesn't seem like something that oh I'd really want because of that fact . Speaker marketing expert: Well , I think again it's it  we have a cost issue here . Speaker user interface: unless you guys are die-hard against the fact that it's possible like it reduces the usability of the remote b and the fact that you can't lose it on your own , I think it still might be a good idea to investigate having like a power cradle . Because I really think i in a certain sense it almost like  for me I would want to have that just , because I know at the end of when I'm done watching T_V_ that when I'm done , oh I better go find the remote and put it back where it belongs . Speaker project manager: Whereas actually just putting it in a power cradle might not be too expensive at all Speaker user interface: The locator'll definitely be more expensive . Speaker project manager: need to look into whether we can do that Speaker user interface: I think one of the things that we can put right on the box is , never buy another battery .",

Let's make this thing really exclusive , environmentally sensitive , high-tech design , ergonomics , all of this . Speaker user interface: I just don't know about that , because in order to do that   in order to price it at that kind of level I think we'd need to have every functionality that all the other competitors are offering like being able to operate , you know , the D_V_D_ player and , you know , the stereo system and all that . Which is a pretty basic function that w we've opted out of . Speaker project manager: I think we can say with certainty now that we are supporting teletext . Speaker user interface: But I do think there are some basic features that we don't have that a lot of other remotes are going to have . Speaker marketing expert: They gave us a fundament a foundation of of what they want , and and w it's our place to kinda analyse and evaluate . I don't know what kind of role we have in this  in the corporate ladder , do we follow their directives or do we make presentations back and and then and then discuss ? beca I I do not  I do not see the market niche for the product that they're handing f handing us right now . Speaker user interface: I think our market niche is basically people who need   who have lost their remote and then they're gonna look on the shelf and they're gonna see ours is the nicest looking remote . Speaker project manager: I th I think it's important to remember that that this remote has to work with multiple T_V_s , yeah , 'cause it's selling on its own . All you need to do is train them to the individual one , Speaker marketing expert: they've identified the product as not working for anything but televisions . If we if w if we were going to have a product that worked for D_V_D_s , V_C_R_s and everything , then I can see the market niche , because who wants just a television remote ? Speaker user interface: If you're in the market for this ultimate remote , you're not gonna go for just a television remote . Speaker project manager: So we really can't chase that . We're really looking for something basic . The the one thing that that that you said really struck a chord with me here in that we're we're carrying the corporate identity with the product , where I'd be inclined to go back to upper-level management and say like let's just cut down our profit expected on this product because we are actually branding our company here . We're trying to get mind-share about Real Reaction to to the people who are gonna buy consumer electronics . And and we're gonna make it  we're gonna win mind-share by either being a fantastic product or for it working , it just being good , reasonable-priced ,  and solid . Speaker marketing expert: W  okay if you if you drop the cost , now if you make if you make  go to the other side of the cost scale , and you make it less expensive , then all of a sudden now we're going into an a a new market area . But what I'm saying is right now we're middle market . Speaker project manager: Is twenty-five Euros a mid-market price for a remote ? Speaker marketing expert: We have to have something that will change people's thinking to identify this as advantageous , It's gotta be low-cost or high-cost with with special design features . Speaker project manager: Well I'd be inclined to say , if we can make the design better than any comparable remote while reducing the cost , then that's the way we really should play it . If we can take it down to you know fifteen rather than twenty-five and make a low profit-margin on it , And I can communicate this to to the more senior  people within the company here to to get a reaction . Speaker industrial designer: we should keep it simple , medium-low cost mar cost area and make it look good . Speaker marketing expert: The box is gonna sell it I think , the outside , the casing . Can can can we have multiple designs ? and so so instead of them all looking the same , people can have maybe four or five different designs they can choose from . I don't know what that creates cost , or  Speaker user interface:  Yeah we we need to , I mean , have a few designs to look at I think w what's really important is it has to look good , it has to be durable , it has to a and I think it's really important that it doesn't look cheap . Speaker marketing expert: what about a a remote that's  that  doesn't maybe look like a remote ? it it opens like a telephone . Speaker user interface: Or what if it looks like a pen ? Speaker marketing expert: I don't have a problem selling a product , Once you have the finished product I'll find a way to sell it . One thing I just thought about when you were saying that , is that the p our target market is gonna be someone who has lost or broken  Can we p can we sell them a remote that can maybe guarantee they will not need to buy another one ? And so with with with this kind of system or locator or something , to to think about , how have people been been losing or breaking their remote ?

I like the idea of of the scroll what I'm looking for as marketing is m give me something different . I give me a lower price , give me a higher price , give me some new technology , when we when we have something like the cradle or or something give that's  Speaker project manager: I'd I'd say though that we  if we did make the decision to go with the cradle though , the then we have that as well , Speaker user interface: Well right I think the two big th points that we have so far are the  having the cradle and also having the the actual design of the case itself having like this like rubber shell maybe with a plastic interior , Speaker marketing expert: Just remember when I made up this report I didn't have the information that we're discussing here . so what I'm saying is , from my perspective , I don't have a product to market right now . my personal preference is that we make some adjustment in the cost , either lower or develop an integrated new technol technology . Yeah again I'm not sold on the product because we don't have a product in my opinion yet . If you if you give me  if you give me a cut-out of what everybody else has then I need to I need to find a lower cost .",

        "text": "Speaker project manager: So our big  questions here really are cradle or not cradle ? Do we go basic or do we go for features ? d does anyone really wanna do anything with the scroll wheel or should we ditch that off-hand first ? Speaker user interface: Well my question is what would the scroll wheel do ?  Yeah . Well it's it's just another way to do the exact same thing that the buttons do . Speaker marketing expert: now what I see with the scroll wheel is everybody has buttons . So from a marketing standpoint I have I have another door to walk through when we have something that's unique . Speaker project manager: What I understand about scroll wheels is they're they're quite expensive to to make . Speaker user interface:  if if we're gonna make up the extra cost by extra sales I think maybe it's worth it to do it , but I mean I would just use  if I was gonna do this I would just use the scroll wheel for s channels up and channels down . No we can  we can do multiple scroll wheels but  Speaker project manager: my personal preference is focusing the p the product on the idea of the the case the the  dock to put it in  to to charge it . We can target like environmentally friendly ideas , that sorta things . It's gonna need to be more expensive because of the cradle . What type of casing ? I personally like what you were saying about the plastic with the rubber . Speaker user interface: I'm thinking  yeah something like kinda almost like these pens , you know , and then it's not really rubber where there's  you have plastic bits but just kinda like a fused  the plastic with rubber on the outside . Speaker project manager: or do we want  if we're ditching the scroll wheels do we want to go L_C_D_ ? d d do we want to do anything more basic with the  more advanced with the user interface in terms of do we want to go for  buttons , Speaker user interface: Or from from my perspective I think L_C_D_ is a mistake and all you're doing  I mean it's  you're not gonna get any information back from the television , so the only information you can display on this remote is what channel you  just sent it at last Speaker marketing expert: so you know unless technology changes and information starts coming out of the  a cable box or something there's no s I don't see the , Speaker project manager: So , what we need to know in terms of marketing and project management are are there any other questions that we need to answer now before you guys can go and build this ? Speaker user interface: Well we have to  I think for me it's still not exactly clear exactly what the inter user interface is gonna be . Speaker marketing expert: You know the other thing I thought about was you know , do we go to something like this ? Make a remote that doesn't look like a remote . Speaker user interface: Well I dunno about like the flip-phone idea , Speaker marketing expert: I mean what I see  one of the things one of the things you brought up in an earlier presentation is , when you got children ,  their their stuff gets inside the circuitry , they get dirty , they get messy with drinks and stuff . And what I keep throwing out there  I just keep throwing out ideas to try to make this thing look or act or in some way identify itself as unique or different . Speaker project manager: and I guess th th the question th  th that you're being asked right now is whether  is the dock enough of a unique feature to be able to go out and sell that a a as a a very different product , or do we really need the scroll wheel as well ? Because the scroll wheel comes at quite a cost . Speaker user interface:  we're probably gonna have to go with a like a medium chip , s I would imagine .  The locator's gonna require a radio transmitter , Speaker marketing expert: I think if you can have the base station with a with a locator , I think those are two very strong features , I know personally that would be a very attractive feature , is to have a have a button I can push to find my remote control . Speaker project manager: And it's presumably gonna need a little speaker in it or something like that as well to beep . But I guess a little tiny speaker is gonna be quite cheap , Speaker user interface: So the scroll wheel , in or out ? Speaker project manager: pr my personal preference is out . Speaker user interface: For me I think the scroll wheel actually might not be so bad . I don't know exactly what the increased cost is gonna be , Speaker marketing expert:  I I think there's  you know that there are so many people today that are that are surfing  are television surfers , and I see the scroll as a as a great mechanism for surfing . Speaker user interface: Now just just so you know though you did bring up a point which is very valid , is a lot of T_V_s won't re the T_V_s won't respond exactly the same . so you may like queue up like fifteen channel changes , and it'll be like flip , flip , flip . Speaker project manager: You could basically make it so that it'll  I mean it's just gonna be sending a signal to the T_V_ yeah the T_V_'s ge so if you send about five flip channels , if you did that it's gonna flip once . Speaker user interface: it just might be frustrating where you can't make it go as fast as you want , Speaker marketing expert: Now the the only thing I I   on the interface side of it , is that  I I I see the dilemma . So I can go  presuming I have , on my television , something that tells me what channel I'm on , I can scroll direct from channel five to channel thirty two . 'cause the television can go automatically from channel five to channel thirty two with the push of a button . Okay ? So ca can we can we create that kind of interface within a scroll system ? Speaker project manager: so if  maybe if we had an L_C_D_ up the top that just did a number on it , right ? Speaker user interface: It'll tell you when you flip the channel on the T_V_ . Speaker project manager: How would you program it though ? Speaker user interface: Well you just  it's one extra button . You say programme start , and then type in  Speaker marketing expert: And again we have another another great marketing tool . Speaker project manager: The problem we're gonna have is making it robust . Speaker user interface: Oh well we also have to determine in some manner how to switch between modes , between going through your favourites list and just hitting up one , up two . Speaker marketing expert: well then you just have , you have a diff you have a mode switch . Speaker project manager: Just a very thin sorta sheet for a a grip , sorta thing or for ",

So the plastic is the white area of this  of the model here , and the red area is like a rubber covering . and the buttons are all gonna be rubber , so it's pretty hard to actually damage it  Speaker project manager: could that be easy to  for the scroll wheel to be rotated if it lands on it ?

So maybe it will be easier for you to to design it , to have very powerful and easy . which will be used for for the television , for the recorder , for the camcorder and all the others , it will become too complex And also we want the image of the real reaction be recognisable in the product , such as the colour and s the slogan .

So first one it's a Google controller . The second is a fancy controller . The last one is intelligent controller . I want the controller to be easy to use , but with sophisticated functions . the first is Google controller . The second concept is a fancy controller , we want give the customers the impression that our controller is very attractive , the u the user f the the u user interface should be very very cute , very very g Such like this , there are several examples in the slides . Speaker project manager:  I'm not sure the one in the middle  is very attractive . We'll have big discussion I suppose after that , Speaker user interface: the last concept is intelligent . so maybe we should use technology , such as speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology , so we need to have coop some cooperation with some research institute on speech recognition and gesture recognition . With this advanced features we  I think we can attract a lot of user . stick to the first two parts . So what's the difference between our controller with other products in the market ? so is there is there any necessary to design new controller without any breakthrough features ? Would y would you replace your controller with a controller with similar function if you do not have some some function inside it that  Speaker industrial designer: we can add for example some function like for browsing in internet , so  or something like that . Speaker user interface: you y that's a fun that's not the function of the controller , Speaker marketing expert: so I I guess if can have a remote control that is really basic , simple and works fine , it's already a lot . if he has something that works fine and is really  fancy , looks nice and it's easy easy to use , easy to use .

Do you think they will be able to use gestures ? Because , if they do all the time the same gesture , as you said previously in the last meeting , maybe they will get injuries because of that ? or if you say channel three channel three two three four six five , I think they will be bored after a while . Speaker user interface: I think some time it's very convenient to use voice interface and gesture interface than use button . For example , if you cannot find your  controller , you can just  just just speak something such as , yeah , one two . Speaker project manager: but suppose you got a cold . You have a mute remote controller . Speaker marketing expert: but how how is  how risky is it to trust like speech recognition or gesture recognition ? Speaker user interface: For limited vocabulary speech recognition is very reliable and for s limited vocabulary gesture recognition is also very  Speaker project manager: but suppose you have a family watching T_V_ , and if they want to use their private remote control in the same time , do you think it will work ? Everybody wanting to change channel in the same time ? so they say oh channel four channel three channel four channel three all the time , Speaker user interface: that's that's the advantage of intelligent controller . Even you h you have the controller , I can  I can say channel three , Speaker marketing expert: No , but this is disadvant disadvantage . Speaker industrial designer: And mayb maybe we can have the switching mode to pass from you know voice controller to Speaker project manager: How how much will it cost ? Speaker industrial designer: more expensive maybe . Speaker user interface: we don't have to do some basic research on this field . Speaker industrial designer: y y you have also the language problem , 'Cause it it have to be universal , Speaker user interface: The vocabulary is very small , Speaker project manager: but there is one problem that Baba talked about is the international The recognition system will be able to understand French . Speaker marketing expert: this could be downloaded by the web maybe , Speaker project manager: And with no increase in the pri production price of the remote control ? Speaker user interface: Even for each f for even for different family we have to do d yeah we would we have to do adaptation to  Speaker project manager: Seems to be quite complex . Speaker user interface: It it just  the microphone is embedded in the controller . Speaker project manager: but wha what is the use of voice or gesture recognition if you have a remote control li like this , if you have an object . If you want to use voice or gesture you need to be free , without any object . you  so you can build a kind of black box and put it on T_V_ and just to recognize gestures and voice . Speaker marketing expert: do you think it should be only voice recognition and gesture recognition ? Speaker user interface: think it  we should give the flexibility to the user You can see  they can switch form one modality to another . Speaker marketing expert: It's a bit risky risky . Speaker industrial designer: But I think that , you know , switching from one country to to another will be a problem , Speaker marketing expert: I'm sure if the user pays the same price , he's happy to have recognition . Speaker project manager: I think it would be better not to do any intelligent controller and to stay with the Google controller or a fancy controller . Maybe try to mix the Google controller and the fancy controller ? Speaker user interface: but with the features of our controller such as you have the feature of voice recognition in your mobile but you seldom use it , your mobile , the feature is not one hundred percent reliable , but it's a feature to distinguish our product from our  from other products .

Like the one you've shown , David , with all the buttons and  I mean  i i it sounds good technically second point is they still want it it to be technologically innovative , so maybe it's sort of related to what you've said with the speech recognition and so on . At the same time , it's important that it's easy to use . that were the three first points from the remote control analysis . Wha what we really see this year is that everything from clothes to shoes and furniture is is inspired by fruits and vegetables , so I think we really have to take this into account for the design of the the thing . And then if if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points , fancy look and feel has , on a score of seven would have six as importance . the remote control has to be technologically innovative , it's three . Then easy to use it's not so important actually with respect to other y other ones . And the other point I haven't mention is people wan want to have a spongy touch , this is this maybe doesn't really fit with the wooden design .

It's it's natural . so maybe we can stay with wood .

Because I think that with the voice and gesture recognition there are still some disadvantages with this . Speaker industrial designer: the problem is I I'm we can infer i if you have v voice control why not to put it directly on the the T_V_ , so speak directly to the T_V_ and you don't need a remote control actually , Speaker project manager: So maybe we'll just focus on the Google controller plus the fancy controller , maybe try to mix them these two concepts together , just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood .

Speaker industrial designer: first would be that in current remote controls there is no back light  , so if you are if you are playing with this in the dark room it's it's probably worth to to have something like back light .

Speaker project manager:  Are you not afraid that if you take your remote control you can move the slide and it could   the the volume can go up very quickly Speaker industrial designer: Yeah but we can we can think of these things afterwards , Speaker user interface: I I prefer remote control working with radio waves , because remote control working with infra-red rays you should you should you should keep it in a specific direction and then try it hard to tune  .",

So basically the major things we found out was that basically users don't like the look and feel of of most remote controls that are currently on the market . seventy five percent of the people we we did the experiments on , found that rem remote the remote controls that they'd used in the past were ugly . they they didn't match the operating behaviour of the user , and thirdly they say that w half of the users that we tested said that they only used ten percent of the buttons that are on remote controls . And from this we basically came up with the figure that the channel buttons , the channel selection buttons are the most  by far the most used buttons on the remote control .

They are based on infra-red waves or radio waves . certainly a remote control with  working with radio waves is preferred because you can pr you can take it in any direction and you don't need to tune it any way . And again , using bigger buttons and less number of buttons are also preferred , as I see . Speaker marketing expert: Do you think radio waves will interfere with other appliances in the home ? Speaker user interface: , I don't think so , Speaker project manager: And what happen with radio waves when two neighbours have the same  have our remote control , for example ?

It's  That mean we should use the colour of our company So we should we should keep  The the product should be recognisable . and maybe put somewhere the s the slogan of the company , which is , we put fashion of  in electronics . So now we we should take the decision what we are going to  what function we will have on this on this remote control . Speaker marketing expert: Well , should we start with just the core , the basic functions that we need . And then we can move on to the more advanced features . Speaker project manager: I think we should stick on very useful functions , because we want less button . So , turning channel , of course . Volume setting . Speaker industrial designer: Because it's many buttons and we were speaking about lowering the number . will we use only two buttons , or or like numbered buttons ? Speaker project manager: Maybe we could have key buttons , like discovery channe like documentary channel , and movies channel and  Speaker industrial designer: so so we keep all these all these buttons . Speaker project manager: If you want to see a movie you click on the movie button so you have all the movie channels and after you've you plus plus plus .

I am the expert in marketing and I want to tell you about what people s want and like and dislike in remote controls , what I suggest is that instead of deciding ourself what what could be and what should be a good remote control , let's ask people who are users of remote controls what they like , what they don't like So we've we've conducted a a survey on on the use of remote controls what we found was that there are several things that the user don't like in remote controls . First of all , they find it very ugly .  they're not nice colour , not nice shape , I mean they're all the same , what is interesting is that in fact it seems that they were  people are ready to pay for nice and look  and fancy looking remote control , so I think we should probably spend lots of time in  and effort in that . and it it  the the current facilities that they offer do not match what people really want to use their remote controls . And the other thing is that the the current remote controls are not so easy to use For instance we see that they zap very often so I think this is a very important functionality And most of the buttons on current remote controls are not used , so I think we should design something where some of the buttons which are those that are used should be easier to see and use than others that only a couple of people are using . people are very frustrated w with their  remote controls and they for instance they don't even find it  it's  it's often lost somewhere in the in the  in your home Maybe if we have something where we could  ask the remote control please , where are you ?  Like something to to  like t I think phones . Some of the phones have some of this kind of s functionality . And because of the fact that there are so many buttons in these remote controls that nobody use , so most of the the people say they they don't know how to  they  to use properly their r remote controls . And they are bad for R_S_I_ but I don't remember what is R_S_I_ . Speaker industrial designer: Yeah , it's electromagnetic waves or something kind of maybe effect . Speaker marketing expert: but we have to take this into account . now I remember what is R_S_I_  it's repetitivity stress injury .",

Speaker marketing expert: that may be used by u the user in the current available remote controls but what is important is to understand that the power button is not used often because in general you  use it only once per session , but it is very relevant .  People want to have a power button . Channel selection is o often used  very often used Volume is not often used but people want to have control on volume And n then you have things which are very much less often used like the settings . Audio settings , screen settings , even teletext and channel settings . All of them . they're not often used and they are s more or less relevant . It seems that people find teletext teletext relevant , but seems that it's average relevant at least , so . Speaker project manager: I have been told that we don't consider teletext , that it's out of date now because of internet . Speaker marketing expert: if if there are good reason not to put teletext it's okay One of the thing  the trend that you are probably aware of is the possibility  the eventual possibility of having speech recognition in your remote control , so you wouldn't have to tap tap in your buttons but just tell your remote control or whatever you need you have what you want . So we've conducted a survey about whether people would like or not to have this kind of functionality in their remote control and as we can see it really depends on the age . Young people , probably because it's a buzz word , find it very relevant . And as the age goes up  the  the relevance goes down .  So now it really depends on the kind of targeting wha who are we targeting with this remote control ? I think if we are targeting young people then it's probably something we have to consider . If we are targeting you very old people this is something they really don't know why they  this should be so that's basically my findings . Speaker user interface: should we aim at the young people or not ? Speaker marketing expert: I think we should aim at the young people . But I think they are  they are those who might be more interested in a in a new device . In general the the early adopters of a new device are young people , Then teletext is useless for them I think , Because they they have other means of finding their information . Yeah .",

        "text": "Speaker user interface: my name is Mark Dwight , and I am responsible for User Interface Design . However , Project Manager asked me to give you some presentation about technical functions design . that's gonna be less technical functions but more User Interface and current intentions and everything which is linked with this . And a general method which is  seems to be very useful for our task We should never complicate things too much . We should only make a remote control , nothing more . Nothing more than this , just a remote control . 'Cause current remote controls they are never easy enough to use . So here is this remote control . It's quite a standard one , but it's not from a T_V_ , it's from a much easier device like air conditioning or something . But you know , we can use it for a T_V_ easily . Only buttons we need is on off , volume , channels and maybe some options or something else , Speaker marketing expert: I would say the simplest one as long as there are the  I find the buttons that I need every time I need a button . Speaker industrial designer: Maybe it can be yeah middle of  like , between those two Speaker user interface: compared to this one Our question of the style , we should remember that our company puts fashion into electronics For personal preferences I think that to make a baby-proof remote control it got to be a titanium . It is unbreakable and it is very universal . W we'll have a screen with a back light which can change colours , and we can put all the options into this screen . We'll need only few buttons . All the other things can be controlled through the screen . And all these buttons should be easy to find and to click , I would propose this concept for design , just few buttons , a screen with a back light which can change colours , titanium We need power and volume . And let us include two nice features into this device , first , power on and off can be made fully automatic . When you go to the sofa , take your control and point it to the T_V_ , the T_V_ turns on . Speaker marketing expert: And when does it turn off ? Speaker user interface: When you don't touch the control For for enough time And another nice feature that I would like to implement is volume control . Suppose you set u you set up some volume and then you move out or you move to the other corner of the room and take your control with you . Like , you want to to change the chair or you want to move to the armchair from the sofa or something , and then the volume changes . Speaker marketing expert: I'm not sure about the screen , According to your distance to  and the angle maybe , if you have a stereo system . wha what is the use usefulness of the screen ? is it a touch screen by the way ? Speaker user interface: I think it can be just a menu which can be controlled with a left , right , up , down and enter . Speaker marketing expert: but it has to be with an back light somehow .  Speaker user interface: So basically that's it . Speaker project manager:  I see that you target several s application not only T_V_ but i like we talk about universal remote control . Speaker user interface: Can be easily done , Speaker project manager: Since we were targeting a really soon date for the the the i issuing of this remote control I think we will only concentrate on T_V_ for the moment and then maybe m make it more generalised  yeah . Speaker user interface: but it's quite universal you know . We can just extend it to any device . Speaker marketing expert: for instance if I want to go to  directly to channel twenty five , how would I do  can I do that with this ? You know these days we have hundreds of channels , Speaker user interface:  In fact I would propose another solution . Basically you use just four or five channels , set up your T_V_ set like channels that you use they're one , two , three and five , and you will never have to go to a twenty fives channel . Speaker industrial designer: But even we can have some L_C_D_ display , like you can de you can just button the number Speaker marketing expert: One thing is that as I said in my presentation people really do like to z zap . So even if they are only watching four or five channels , I think they want to zap out of the one hundred channels , Speaker project manager: on zap it's only next next next next next , yeah . Speaker industrial designer: But otherwise like we can put some display on numbers Speaker user interface: . We got these buttons here . Next next . Speaker project manager: Maybe we can make different modes for each button and you can change mode  zapping mode or Speaker industrial designer: but since we are focusing only on T_V_ remote controls so we can have more functions for T_V_ Speaker user interface: Could we carry out some research if we w really need this , like how many people really need to go to channel number twenty five and then to sixty four ?

I am an expert in industrial design of all electronic devices  So now I'll briefly describe the working design of our remote control . as you know the basic function of remote control is sending some message to the the device , like T_V_ or V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player etcetera . So we need to have some energy source to do what  to do the functions , what we want on this portable device .  so to do these functions we need an interface , which basically some kind of pressing buttons or keys or like moving jack or something like that . And then these messages  these key buttons can be transferred into some kind of message and then it will process by the chip and then it will generate some information to the main device . since we are focusing on our interface device  remote control mainly the energy source like the battery and then we have user interface like the keypad and you know buttons we want , we ought to have some kind of processor And then we'll have the infrared L_E_D_ source Then we'll have switch in our main device to do particular operations , and we ought to do different codes for different T_V_s , Speaker project manager: To make it quite an universal device . Speaker industrial designer: because the people don't use one particular brand so So we need to check their specifications So we need to have particular encryption codes . so I'll input the connections to all this components . so if you want to add some more components we can incorporate them . Speaker project manager: Mm-hmm . And from from the discussion we had do you  can you make it on the whiteboard , or  . Speaker industrial designer: and also Marketing Expert for the speech recognition is really handy , we can have another , like s simple speech recogniser on our D_S_B_ chip . and we can have some speech recognition and in our g generally small digital signal processing chip so that and we will put the small simple speech recogniser you can find even simple mobile device like any mobile brand you can have these voice dialers or these things , yeah . Speaker marketing expert: Think of a all these young people who would love to say that this remote control only works for them , Speaker project manager: And what about the price of this component ? Speaker industrial designer: maybe we can make it in five Euros and even less than that , Speaker marketing expert: The user will just be able to say please can you pump up the vo pump up the volume or or it will be something like volume , up , down . Speaker industrial designer: And then we can have channel they can say , okay I want eight , we don't want like B_B_C_ or C_N_N_ or something else it will be complicated Speaker marketing expert: First of all I I think this is not functionality that it is going to be instead of using the buttons . Speaker industrial designer: actually we we can have one switch to like switch on , on and off , this  processor Speaker user interface: Did you consider the r gest gesture recognition ? Like , if I want to put volume up I like do  I take my remote control do like  something like roll 'em up or roll 'em down . Speaker marketing expert:  Very expensive , Speaker industrial designer: even automatic on off is also a bit problematic , like so suppose people are really they just they don't touch the remote and y you don't know how much time you need to switch on or switch off Speaker marketing expert: So in in a given room there might be more than one remote control . We would have each one and with our own personal settings . Speaker industrial designer: Yeah that can be possible , especially for power settings , so user can say okay , suppose they're watching a tennis match or something then they can say okay after one hour I  because we have only very few words like like power , switch on or some like so we try to only recognise those words and and because we can't really say user to say same wording",

For energy there are maybe two or three possibilities . First one , we can use simple battery , or we can use  traditional solar cells and the material we can have plastic , rubber which is good for this R_S_A_ and then titanium , which can be  which have very good look an and then interface we're to use push buttons or liquid crystal d L_C_D_ display . we would like to have some speech recognition s chip in our remote control . this can be simple kind of programmable chip which can use microphone  sensors . Still we are looking for possible technical specifications and how w easy we can do and within our pri range , like we're to  in our twelve Euros or around that . So we are looking for simple devices or simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house . we would like to propose battery instead of solar cells and it would be problematic to have enough energy with the solar cells And also we want to go for titanium design instead of rubber or  the problem is with this design we found that we can't use double-curved shapes . Speaker marketing expert: What is a double-curved shape ? Speaker industrial designer:  Like you can have two curves . we want to go for simple push buttons because it need a simple chip and it's really lesser  re really less expensive compared to L_C_D_ which needs advanced chip technology and it's more expensive , since we want to put some other features such as speech recognition we want to reduce cost . Speaker project manager:  I want to know why it b just sorry but for the point before why not the rubber , if it is something that it seems to be light . Speaker industrial designer:   And also like in  if you put a  it's be difficult to do all the moulding of buttons and these things Speaker user interface: W we can use something like you know  the whole body's titanium but there are some rubber or I dunno some rubber parts Speaker industrial designer: But full assembly  We'll use mainly for titanium  and also it's bit difficult to do all the shapes .  we we would like to use push buttons instead of L_C_D_s Y yeah we have simple buttons and speech recognition technology , Speaker user interface: can we still include the L_ L_S_D_ display ? Speaker marketing expert: it's either L_C_D_ or push-button . Speaker industrial designer: maybe maybe we can see depending on how we'll come up with our full design because the speech recognition technology will take at least five Euros or  or something so we want to reduce the cost on display Speaker user interface: it's it's not gonna be a touch pad , just a display for giving you information . Speaker marketing expert: the batteries are going to be very light . Speaker industrial designer: and now I think we have many options in the market so we can go for small nickel or alkaline batteries Speaker marketing expert: this device on n that can be used for speech recognition could also be used for just the finding it basically , instead of clapping why not just be  ask .

If you use colour L_C_D_ . instead of that maybe we can change the colour of the assembler . if users want more colours they can pay more money to get this the shapes and they can have different assembly .

Anyway these days the best source of information is the web as you know , but basically there are  in in the market of of remote controls there are three aspects that we should very  pay much attention to . The first one , which seems to be the most important one , is that it has to be fancy , it has to have a fancy look and feel . And interestingly this is the very most important thing . It has to be fancy . Strangely enough it's more important to be fancy than to be wi and now that's the second thing it has to be , it has to be technologically i innovative , it has to be new with some of new technology inside and and this is also more important than the last thing which is that it should be easy to use and it should be easy to use as a remote control . And finally of course it has to be useful as a remote control but it seems that it's not so important that it's useful as a remote control .  currently the the trends that we see in l in l big cities like Paris and Milan , well , it seems that this year things should have a fruit and vegetable way of  of look or feel And I think of course  i it applies to everything .  It it can travel f from clothe to furniture  same idea . And if we co we compare to last year , now it has to be spongy , When we were talking about rubber , I think the rubber aspect might be important because it's what is probably more feasible in terms of sponginess . Speaker project manager: So maybe titanium it's not a good idea . Speaker marketing expert: Think more of something in the colours of like fruit and vegetables and spongy , even in the shape it has to be more round and more look natural somehow . I mean  And not those futuristic remote control with angles and and titanium like . Speaker industrial designer: these abilities are mainly ad addressed by young people ? Speaker marketing expert: we have people listening to the trends everywhere in the world , of course , Speaker industrial designer: It's more general trend it's not particular to the remote control .

Do we take titanium smelling like fruit , or do we make spongy fruity-like Speaker industrial designer: we will try to explore these two options Speaker marketing expert: Maybe you could explore the two option . Speaker user interface: Could we make a titanium shape ? I mean  fruit-shaped . Speaker industrial designer: at least like we can make banana Speaker user interface: Doub double-curved . Speaker project manager:  Don't you say that you cannot do double shape  curved shape  Speaker industrial designer: and and s we're to see the  whether rubber is expensive Speaker user interface: In fact I just agreed to make to make the  like titanium panels on a whole rubber body . Speaker project manager: you explore now that you're going to work together these these two . Speaker industrial designer: Maybe we can have two different  assembly also like one spongy and one kind of titanium . Speaker project manager: I think we have to choose . If we choose titanium or if we choose spongy Speaker industrial designer: still we want to keep L_C_D_ ? Or  Speaker project manager: I think it's what we say , that we have an an L_C_D_ with information . Speaker marketing expert: The thing is that if we want to have as he says  if we want to have a small number of buttons we need to have a kind of output that says currently what their actions are . That's the converse to having zillions of button where each button does only one thing . Speaker industrial designer: and we just stick with two batteries so it's not any solar or  Speaker marketing expert: in general I think people change T_V_ more often than batteries of their remote control .

Or or you can say for example ,   I want to list all the programme tonight . Just say maybe I just want to press  I wanna have a button for all the movies tonight . So instead of pressing the channel number , I am choosing the programmes directly . Speaker project manager: I I think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly . Like s you you you say we can use speech . Speaker user interface: The  the idea of using speech to reduce the button , but and it's more natural . Yeah . Speaker marketing expert: I mean the main function of remote control is to have something in the hand and we should be very careful about the size of the remote control . If we are going to add a speech interface , I'm not sure with  trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog if you want to put a speech recognition system f interface for that I think the T_V_ itself could have it . And I could talk to the T_V_  television itself . Speaker user interface: But th the main idea I wanted to s I wanted to say is that  there should be a function , instead of choosing the ch T_V_ channel , there's a option you can choose , either T_V_ channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme . Speaker industrial designer: Yeah , yeah it's it's a good idea it's a good idea but I I think that technically it would be a little bit more tricky to to achieve this than just to  Speaker user interface: because you see now all the T_V_ programmes are available on the webs . We just want to retrieve the content so we can just use the service available . And then there's  there are only six buttons for six categories , or sev seven . The most there are only seven buttons . So I just choose the category one and you reuse the same button , for example to to choose among the the sorted list the programme you want , Speaker industrial designer: Well I I I I think that j just by using navigation buttons and the user interface on the screen we are able to navigate through the  Well channel programme or contents or  in an easy way , so  Speaker user interface: Yeah , so you don't have to display here , just display on the T_V_ screen , right ? Because all the T_V_ the the remote control have all numbers , lots of buttons Speaker industrial designer: and just with the with your remote control would just navigate through the f I think for for the technical points we have to to to check how to gather the data from programme or contents and all this stuff Speaker marketing expert: And another interesting idea for this would be to have an light adaptation system depending upon the picture of  So , I mean , if you're watching a movie and suddenly there is a dark  some dark scene , the lights adapt themself . The lighting in the room changes . Speaker user interface: Yeah , but we are designing just remote control . Speaker marketing expert: I mean , we have a option in the remote control . If we want to have that option , you press that button in the remote . Speaker user interface: Okay , do you want to have a conceptual remote control there , or you just want to put the function in ? the most important function is to ch choo buttons to choose the content . Right ? , first one is to  buttons i or it could be anything with  buttons . to choose content s or channels . Speaker industrial designer: And we we have to find a way how to gather information about the contents .

You can put it on the charger when you when you don't need to use it . Speaker industrial designer: It's a good idea . Speaker marketing expert: Having a charger rather than putting the battery cells always . People don't like it to have to buy the batteries when they run out . We just make a small charger Speaker user interface: Because you are using because you are using Bluetooth , if some people have P_D_A_ they can use their P_D_A_ to control the T_V_ if they want to , right ?

So for energy sources we have we have to choose between the solar energy , hand dynamo and kinetic well kinetic technique  to to store the energy . We also  we also can put a regular battery in the in the remote control . we didn't decide yet which kind of battery we will put inside the the remote . So it's a point to discuss . Concerning the interface we can we can put just simple buttons or scrolls or buttons much more complicated , but it also requires that the chip to process the button is more complicated so .  And this is the last point , the choice of chips . Speaker user interface: What is this single curved  Speaker industrial designer: Well i i it's it's the the shape of the of the remote . You you will have the  well the the curve will fit into your hand when you grab the  It's more confog f comfortable that if these it's completely flat . Speaker user interface: And the battery , is it kind of a rechargeable or it doesn't matter ? Speaker industrial designer: Yeah the that's the point . The kinetic one is y you can recharge by the  and by  well by just by moving the ar your arm the well the remote will accumulate energy .",

They group them into col they colour them and they have different forms as well . but this interface are kind of confusing . basically there are too many buttons . So some people are propose voice recognition ah by the way I receive an email from the from one our departments saying that the voice recognition has been used in the coffee machine  for this by a company when you tell the  you say good morning coffee machine and the machine are reply to you . And it seems like this voice recognition technology is ready to be used so we might consider that , supposedly . so somebody  some people use some people use a spinning wheel th with the L_C_ display so instead of using the buttons you have a L_C_D_ screen and then there you can u you can use that as buttons , Touch screen , I mean . And some people propose a scroll button . Integrated with push buttons or you may have scroll button instead of p just the push button . so there are a few aspects that I collected here . So s basically this deals with special users , children , handicapped people , old people , basically they are programmable , And then they also secure covers , to protect secure and hidden programming and battery covers that will protect your settings . But we don't have to integrate all these complicated features . I'm just saying that the  currently in the market there are there are control there are remote controllers f  customisable for different people . And you see this is the one where you have the protection cover . maybe useful for children , And for adults wh where you have more control you can see the one inside . So the adults might wanna have a key to lock that to pr so children will not touch the button inside . this is another company that provides big buttons . I see that that is useful for old people But for our product we don't need a big one because you have voice recognition e eventually with use . Speaker project manager:  We should include speech synthesis in this case , no ? Speaker industrial designer: but as Norman say if there is already a commercial product available who t who do this we we can check to integrate it i into our new remote control . Speaker user interface: And , this is another one the the the part that's a V_ standing for the volume . So there's a up arrow and a down arrow . But you the see that in the V_ , the V_ appears to be the down arrow on the top  so it's confusing interface , And here are  is here is a s short summary that I summary that I compiled after the findings I found . Big buttons are convenient , voice recognition helps , push buttons , scroll buttons , spinning wheels can be used as navigation tools . And user customisable is important and finally simplicity simplicity is the key . we have many concepts there but we have to choose later on which ones are important to be used . Speaker industrial designer: Well I  I think you it's it's it's fine you have reviewed all all the possibilities but well i if we consider that the user interface is displayed on the T_V_ screen I don't think we nee we need much buttons in the remote since we we just have to navigate and to have a okay or enter key or things like that , because adding wheels or scrolls makes the thing more complicated and more expensive also , so .",

Speaker marketing expert: that's exactly what I mean by voice commander . it's always boring to change the batteries of the remotes control , and whenever we don't use the remote control we put it in the charger . so we have some one charger there And when we're using that t remote and if we misplace somewhere , in the charger we have a small button , and just by pressing the button in the charger the remote control beeps , wherever it is . Speaker industrial designer: And that's a good idea , Speaker marketing expert: I mean it doe it also doesn't require a voice command , because there are problems with a voice command . I mean charger would be fixed because it's always with electricity plugged . Speaker user interface: what we can do is we can program a function whereby when you press the switch off T_V_ button , the off button , the remote there be s instruction on the screen , please charge charge me .

I mean  I mean I mean you see if it's like that even a kid who wants to have a control he could just plug it and  use it , you can't avoid him .

You see if you have a voice commands and you are s you are watching a score on  basketball score or something , and if the score comes twenty four thirty five , you've just say twenty five and suddenly  the screen the channel goes to twenty five .

And here the the switch that control if you want  Speaker user interface: The the microphone picks up the speeches from anywhere . Speaker marketing expert: Is it an only a single mic or a microphone array ? Speaker industrial designer: Well so it's a microphone array . Speaker project manager: Oh it's very costly , microphone array  . Speaker industrial designer: it's just a single microphone , I I think we we put it here because I think when you when you are browsing your L_C_D_ you will be close to  well it's better to to to place it here th than here , for instance . And here is a little switch that control if you want the the speaker recognition system to to be on or off . And so this remote control comes up with its charger . Speaker project manager: How many b battery is there ? Speaker user interface: Is it n the two A_A_s batteries in it . A_A_ rechargeable batteries . Speaker marketing expert: Is that two or one ? Speaker user interface:  Actually it's a flexible thing . Speaker industrial designer: So and if you want to charge the battery you just put the remote control like that to plug in the the charger and leave it alone , it's alright . Speaker user interface: I forgot to tell you there is only a single button there , This button is like the mouse  is like a joystick , you can move in three hundred and sixty degrees of direction and it  the additi functions associated to all the actions you ma you have a click you have a double click all in a single button  . You can move up , down , left , right , or you can do a swing . Here I present another version without the L_C_D_ .

The second version is also simpler , we d we had just I have to put the microphone also  . Speaker marketing expert: Uh-huh and also the switch . Speaker industrial designer: Basically it's the same things as I presented before . But here we have we have four buttons for navigation . Press one button acting as a a enter button . So yeah according to what you said it's more robust to the user . And it's also cheaper to produce .

It's that same charger that you can use for the hand-phone but again depends on the types . I think we have to investigate more on that , but   Again and the battery life is is an is an endurable one , again because this is A_A_ batteries you can choose the types of battery you want . Lithium-ion may be a good one , again you pay for what you get , And it also use a programmable channel and vocabulary , So when you finish watching your T_V_  and you the you t you turn off the T_V_ , and then there's this message coming out that please put that back to the charger , and then y the other p points are robust and misplacement reminder . so we didn't define the vocabulary so it's up to the user to define And then because of the chil because children are using the device so we have also a a  of T_V_ programmes by genre , and this can be used by the adult or by the children .",

And the second thing is it should be much more technologically innovative . Of course in that we could put L_C_D_ or recognition to be more technologically innovative .

Well I think that the technical in innovation is is in the product itself Speaker marketing expert: here you can find  these are the latest fashion updates , and so this  in Paris and Milan  they have detected this trends that the this year it's going to be an year of fruit and vegetable , so people are really interested to see if they have an remote in the shape of the fruit or a vegetable , or whatever they like . So I think it should be much more customised to make a different shapes .

Speaker user interface: But who will give the scoring we ourself or or a third party ? Speaker marketing expert: according to you designers , On on this scale the L_C_D_ remote control . How do you look  how does it look ? D is it very fancy or doesn't look much fancy ? Speaker industrial designer: I'll I'll say three or four . Speaker user interface:  I think we can improve on the design . Som someone commented this is like a the stone age   design . we have been focused all all this  time on the  on the technical aspect , functional aspect , but also the simplicity . Speaker marketing expert: So I take three on  with L_C_D_ ? So without L_C_D_ how would you rate it ? Speaker industrial designer: four . I think it's it's more easy to make f fancy things when it's not complicated so removing the L_C_D_ gives us a li more liberty to to have a fancy look . Speaker marketing expert: And in the sense of innovativeness , with L_C_D_ . Speaker industrial designer: Well it's it's the same for both so  I will give a five , six .  Speaker user interface: from the innovation aspect I feel that what is most innovative of our prototype compared to the existing prototypes that we saw l in the last meeting is that  the retrieval of T_V_ programmes by content , and for now  and another innovation we have is simplicity and  simplicity , few buttons , we've   A lot of functionalities . Speaker marketing expert: So without L_C_D_ ? Speaker industrial designer: for both it's the the same innovations . Speaker user interface: So maybe I can put six to seven . Speaker marketing expert: actually to make it with L_C_D_ you make more efforts . then when it is without L_C_D_ there is not much innovativeness . So without L_C_D_ you want to put it fi the same level of innovativeness ? Speaker industrial designer: Well I think both are really easy to use and well t p the menu are clear , well-organised , so  so I will give a six for the easy to use . Speaker project manager: No it's just if I I see the the f the rate I think it's better to do it without L_C_D_ . Because that's with L_C_D_ just will increase the price , Speaker marketing expert: So I mean in the product design you could just amend it to make some few changes according to fruit and vegetable or a spongy touch without L_C_D_ and without speech recognition . Speaker user interface: I have another thing to say about the easy to use aspect . I think the easy to use aspect is different for different people .

But  I just  took some  different schematics and I guess this is what a slide might look like if you were drawing a circuit board . personal preferences ,  I I'm really thinking outside the box here , and I think that we should consider perhaps having an an an a a size   a remote control that changes in size depending on the user preference . So something that's very very flexible and inflatable I think it could either be  you could go either one extreme , be very colourful , or you could make it clear , and kind of blend in with things , I think it needs to be waterproof , because sometimes they fall into cups one of my requirements was about needs t to tell you when it's done its job or not , because half the time , I keep pushing on the remote control , and I don't know if it's actually understood my message , so I think it should give you some sort of an oral cue .

For what I think from what we're trying to find , we're tr we're looking for , I don't think that price is exactly in the market . in the recent surveys , from the ages  fr from fifteen to thirty-five , eighty percent are willing to spend more money for something as fancy as trendy . Twenty-five Euros , that's that's a preson reasonable price . Now if we're gonna take a risk , and push this up a bit , make it more expensive , then it w it could possibly sell . But , I think there's one other thing interesting  two things that are interesting  is that from the fifteen to thirty-five year-old group , which always spends more money on trendy new things , speech recognition is requested . And we're talking between seventy-five to ninety percent of this group is willing to pay for speech recognition on a remote . Obviously , we can't make a remote into a computer , but maybe simple commands . louder , softer , on , off . Thirty-five percent say they're too difficult to use . So we have to figure out a way of making it more user friendly .  fifty percent say they can't find the remote half the time .  So maybe one word speech recognition commands , say remote , and there's a beep beep beep , But , in the cost that the management is looking for , that's not gonna be possible . But if it's trendy , if it's fancy , it's got some colour to it , if it's very easy  easy to use , if it's got simple remote  speech remote control , like I said , louder , softer , change channel , on , off , remote , it goes beep beep , So we're gonna have to look at it in a  in this global idea , with the ideas of the industrial design . But , price obviously we have to talk about . Speaker project manager: What do you think about the design , what he was talking about  of the speech recognition ? Speaker industrial designer: training is always an issue with commands .  we can perhaps  do it if the user is willing to spend some time in the training process ,  But anyway ,  I I think also that this might impact the battery life . maybe what we'll have to do is add something where you can recharge it wirelessly or maybe set it out in the sun and it , you know , gets , from the light , a a solar cell inside there Speaker user interface: It seems also like with the speech recognition , yeah , it's a great feature , but if you're watching T_V_ , there's a lot of ambient sound , so then you have to make sure that the speech recognizer is good enough to filter out the T_V_ speech , and the the user's speech . Speaker marketing expert: Because tha w  with speech recognition th I'm not that good at that idea Because I think s with speech recognition , if the the remote or like the telephone   it has a exact word that it has to hear .

        "text": "Speaker user interface: the method that we usually use in the user interface design is that we need to look at what people like and what people don't like about existing products . So , in our case , existing remote controls . We seem to have intuitions about why things are good or things are bad , but when you look , technically , at how it works , sometimes that's not the case . Then we need to decide what functionalities we really want to keep , and then what the remote control should look like , in terms of the functionalities that we need , you obviously need to be able to turn the T_V_ on and off . You need to change channels , both by directly going to a specific channel or by channel surfing . You need to be able to control the volume and then control any menus on the T_V_ to regulate contrast or whatever . the problems that people have expressed is that there's too many buttons on remote controls , in general . The buttons  it's not clear what they're supposed to do . often , you need to know specific button sequences  to get certain functionalities done , which you don't necessarily always remember , especially if it's a functionality that you don't use very often . here we've got two examples where here on the left-hand side , you can see a remote control that has lots and lots of buttons . The buttons , in a lot of cases , are tiny . they're labelled , but the labels don't necessarily tell you too much . Whereas , on the other side , you have a much simpler remote control that I think basically has the minimum functionalities  that are needed . And it sort of looks simpler and just less imposing when you first look at it . So , I would be inclined to go sort of towards this , in terms of design , rather than this . And if there's specific functionalities that require more buttons , then we can figure out how to do it with existing buttons . So my personal preferences are to keep the number of buttons to a limit , or to a minimum , make frequently used buttons bigger and more strategically placed , so like the on button being really obvious one , the channel changing and the volume , and to keep the design basically sleek and simple . Speaker industrial designer: Clearly your research and  and ours heading in the same direction , the only thing that I saw missing from your your research that we found was this ability to find the doggone thing when you need it . I also think that th f the the feel of it is , when you hold it , is something that was expressed more in in in in my design 'cause those are the parameters that an Industrial Designer's more thinking about , th th the look and the feel , Speaker user interface: that's definitely a very important factor , especially to users who are gonna be buying the thing and then using it almost on an  daily basis in a lot of cases , I think .

In instance we had talked about using some sort of speech recognition , you have to have microphone  well no you don't actually I haven't  have to have microphone in the device , it has to it has to hear the speaker so it could be in the television set , could be in the device , and a w a way of making beeps or sounds so you can find it when it's gets lost . Our method for going about this is we've looked at the histo hi historical record , what's worked , what hasn't and then we also  we wanted to evaluate some new materials and we contacted manufacturing for their input because , course , we m might  come up and choose the material that then manufacturing didn't have the technologies or capabilities to offer us , So for the case , we told we were making a specifica specific assumption that it would be curved in design . Course , you know , I wanted it to be expandable and shrinkable , but that doesn't seem to b be one of the choic non-option we can  we can really seriously explore ,  so then we were thinking about rubber , but unfortunately that's been eliminated because of the heat factor and th there might be some  problems with the m how it's   goes with the board .  and then th plastic also has this problem of melting and it's brittle  it gets brittle after a while , so we still had titanium and and wood available , but unfortunately titanium's also been eliminated , the m people in manufacturing said that you couldn't make d curved cases out of titanium , So then there's this other matter of the chips and well we could use a simple design on the board ,  these simple chips , but that's only works for the bu you don't get very much intelligence with this simple one . And then there was the regular which  I regret that I've forgotten exactly why I'm eliminating that one . the other option was this advanced chip on print , we found that it it includes this infrared sender , which w 'member the beam was  that was an important component of finding the right chip . And manufacturing has told us that they've recently developed a a sensor and a speaker that would be integrated into this advanced chip on print , now jumping right to our personal preferences and then I think we should go with the solar cells as well as the microphone and speaker on the advanced chip . Speaker project manager: question , , what's mean exactly , advanced chip on print ?

        "text": "Speaker user interface: So , it's a very short presentation , 'cause I'm actually gonna draw you the layout on the board I took the ideas that we were talking about last time and tried to put that into the remote control so the things that y you can actually see on it are the on off switch , volume and channel control , the menu access button , ergonomic shape , which I completely agree with Christine's idea to have it sort of molded , so it's slightly more ergonomic and comfortable to hold than the r standard very straight remote controls . And actually the other thing with the wood if we take your customising idea , is that people can actually do sort of quasi-measurements on their hand size , so if someone has larger hands , you have a wider remote control .  So , that's actually a really good idea for customi customisability . , one thing I thought might be kind of interesting is to put a flip screen on it , just like you have on flip phones , so that you don't have this case where someone sits on the remote control or accidentally puts their hand on it , especially if you have little kids around , they're not pressing the buttons while you're trying to watch a T_V_ show and accidentally change the channel or turn it off . And also  you had issues with the batteries running out , so I thought maybe we could put a little battery life-light on it that kind of goes dimmer and dimmer and dimmer as your battery is  starts to die . And in terms of invisible features , audio and tactile feedback on button presses and , like you said , speech recognition . You'd have something like this with an on-off switch fairly big , sort of in the corner and by itself , so you don't accidentally turn your T_V_ off while you're trying to manoeuvre other buttons . And then you have sort of one of those toggle displays for , oops , channels and volume , sort of for surfing channels and then volume , so the volume would be the up and down , 'cause volume goes up and down and then channels left to right . And then here you'd have your sort of standard , telephonish number pad . and on the other side a way to turn off the voice control . , so again you can have a little L_C_D_ light somewhere , the flip  thing and  So , as you can see , it's a very very simple design , which is one of the things I really wanted to keep , is keep it simple , not have too many buttons , not have too many functionalities thrown into it . although with the wood the flip screen might have to do something slightly different . Speaker industrial designer: Be like a copper hinge or you know . Speaker user interface: But you also have to d start watching out for the weight , 'cause depending on how much the the flip screen will add to the weight of the remote control , you don't want it to start getting too heavy . As you can see , there's still lots of space on the actual remote control and if you do it customisably ,  you can make this thing fairly small or fairly o large , depending on personal preferences . the centering of the key pad and  the channel is just depending on where your thumb is and you tend to use the the volume control and the browsing more than the actual number pad , so that would be sort of in direct line of where your thumb goes when you are holding the remote control , the number pad a little bit lower 'cause it's used less frequently . So once we decide exactly what we want , then we can figure out the exact positioning ,",

Speaker user interface: I've done a presentation , but it pretty much covers work that we've both done , so if I'm missing anything , Christine can just correct me . from  when we were discussing specifying the case in the last meeting , we decided that we wanted an ergonomic shape , so in terms of function , you have to be able to turn the T_V_ on and off , volume and channel control , menu control , voice recognition control , The yellow button you have is the on off button , so it's really big , hard to miss . You have the the red triangles are the toggles for changing the volume . The green are the channel changing . And then you have the numeric pad in the dark blue at the bottom , and on the right-hand side you have the access to the menu on the T_V_ , and on the left-hand side you have the the the ability to turn off the voice recognition . the material that we chose was wood , and the colour would be customisable , 'cause you can stain the wood whatever colour . Speaker industrial designer: We haven't specified where the speaker or the microphone will be placed . That depends on the s design of the circuit board inside and what room is left  Speaker project manager: I think the microphone is on on the top , on the middle , the  under the flip . Speaker user interface: But it shouldn't be under the flip either , because you can have the remote control closed , but you still might want to activate it by voice . Speaker project manager: my opinion I think it's better under the flip because whenever you want to the talk , okay , so then you can speak then you can close it . But if you put it on the on the flip , okay , then technical I don't think it's feasible , 'cause most of the time you speak then it will be recognised . Speaker user interface: I mean the whole point of the voice is that if the remote control is sitting there and I'm too lazy to reach over and pick it up , I can just use my voice . I mean it doesn't have to be on the flip , Speaker project manager: Yeah , the sides maybe is good . Speaker industrial designer: You need to work on the weight a little bit .  Speaker user interface: And maybe the shape of the buttons , the little egg shapes aren't the most economical , but  Speaker project manager: I'm satisfied . Speaker user interface: We could have possibly made it a lot thinner as well .

Speaker industrial designer: . It's gonna cost a long way to c you know , cost a lot of money to market it , is it ?

Speaker marketing expert: We don't have the price up there , Speaker user interface: you're right , sorry , yes .

Speaker marketing expert: Yeah well that's already been eliminated by management , so we're off the hook  . Speaker industrial designer: So user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages it's like el the text or buttons which which are there on the remote controller they  those we can make like fluorescent if suppose a child is playing with the remote controller and a and she she or he is pressing the buttons all at the time then there should be a beep saying that it's  this this is not a a you know a a action , there can be no action taking to that so . like you should be able to lock your remote controller so that whatever buttons are pressed by a child they can't be like y you i you if you have ki kids and all then they'll be pl playing with the remote controllers so can lock the remote controller .

It has to be original , trendy , and user friendly . project method is there are three phases we are going through . First is functional des design , individual work , meetings . After the functional design , then the conceptual design and the detailed design . The Industrial Designer is going to work on the working design , components design and a bit of the look and feel design . the User Interface Designer is going to do the technical function design , user interface concept and user interface design .  And the marketing expert is doing a little bit of user requirement specification , trend watching and project  product ev evaluation . But that will be all worked out in other meetings .",

We're going to draw animal .  And just sum up a few of its favourite characteristics . the only thing we have to look after is that we use different colours , and different line width . You can use this pen by holding it like a like a little child . Because if you hold it like this , the sensors will get blocked Another thing is you have to be a bit slow . 'Cause if you're going to draw like really fast then the pen won't hold up . we choose form of current colour I think grey is appropriate . Now you'll see my drawing capabilities . you have to do it real slow . I was trying to draw a dolphin ,  And then you can undo Maybe you have to hold it a bit upside-down . now I'm gonna hand over the pen on the new blank sheet to you .

We have we have been doing research in a usability lab where we observed users operating remote controls . we let them fill out a questionnaire . in addition we did some market research . see what the market consists of . What ages are involved . these are three quite astonishing results , I thought . seventy five percent of the people questioned indicated that they thought their remote were was ugly . and an additional eighty percent indicated that they would spend more money on a fancy-looking remote control . in addition remotes were not very functional . Fifty percent of the people indicated they only loo used about ten percent of the buttons on a remote control . And fifty percent of the people indicated that their remote tended to get lost in their room . Then we did some research to the most relevant functions . Channel selection and volume selection both got a ten on a scale of one to ten for relevancy . The power button got a nine . And teletext got a six and a half . Then there are some one-time use function . That audio settings , video settings , and channel settings buttons . Which are not really used very frequently , but are still considered to be of some importance . channel selection was also indicated to be used very frequently . One hundred and sixty eight times per hour . sixty percent of the market consists of users between the ages sixteen and forty f six . the users of forty six to sixty five years cons The make up forty percent of the market . They are not really very interested in features . But they do tend to spend their money a lot easier . What I think this indicates for our design . I think we should make a remote for the future . And this means we would have to focus on the age ages sixteen to forty five . this would mean we would have to make a fancy design .  The results also indicated that about one quarter of the people questioned thought that the remote control caused R_S_ R_S_I_ . And thirty four percent thought that it was hard to learn a n how to operate a new control , remote control . I think we should make very few buttons .

The remote determines what button it is , uses the infrared to send a signal to the T_V_ . The T_V_ switches to the frequency , or what function it is . we've got the the plate . It gots conductive disks for every button . When the user presses a button , a signal got sent , goes to the LED and transmits tranmi transmits its to the T_V_ . this is a schematic overview . You've got the buttons . The power source . And when a button gets pressed , its goes to the chip . I think we should use default materials , simple plastics . Keep the inner workings simple , I think we should focus on aesthetics , the design and the user interface , and if you use high-tech materials it come back in every product . it's , in my idea , it's it's gonna be smart to invest in di in design and not in in the product itself . Speaker project manager: so I'm here to mess things up and tell you some new requirements . we've got to design a remote which is only suitable for T_V_ . that's because  it will be too complex and the time to market will be too big , if we wanna have it for more functions . another point is we have to skip the teletext , because in the world of upcoming internet we think teletext is going to be a thing of the past . Another one is the customer is forty plus . that's the the market we have to to to target , because we are going to develop a new product which is specially designed for the younger customers .

Speaker marketing expert: 'cause you're you're saying that teletext is gonna be an old feature But I think if you're targeting people of forty plus , the chance that they will have a T_V_ with internet access within the next like twenty years is very slim . In addition people indicated that teletext simply was an important feature for the remote control . So I think it's pretty dumb to put no teletext feature on it . Besides that , I think the market for forty plus is like pretty small . But I mean if I s if I see this , it's  I think we're just gonna go for another Speaker project manager: Standard remote . I think we can do a lot with the design and the simple buttons if we put a lot of effort in those , we can make a remote control with just two or three buttons . Or just a remote which is suitable for the market we wanna reach if you look in Holland at the whole generation of forty plus , fifty plus , it it's the the biggest share of the of the whole population now . But don't you think that if we make a remote which is typically made for this market , that people think   the people think that's the the device I've looked for although I didn't realise it . Speaker industrial designer: I think that if we're  If we put our marketing right we can sell this just like  I don't know if you've heard about it in the news , the the elderly mobile phone ? if we if we make a remote control just l with that idea in mind , we could make tons of money , I think . We don't have to focus on on on the on the design then but on functionality . Speaker project manager: I think teletext can be can be a function as well . But only if if it won't higher the the cost , Speaker user interface: But deaf people need teletext for for subtitles . Speaker marketing expert: I think it'd definitely be a bad idea not to include teletext . Speaker project manager: Is anybody really against teletext ? I think that's a good idea as well , especially for the subtitles . I think that's very important we have a few buttons . Speaker user interface: So we can s we can skip the display , Speaker project manager: But do you need the buttons for one to zero . Speaker marketing expert: Think if you're gonna include teletext you do . Speaker project manager: Or a joystick like ? maybe we can implement the scroll button ? Just look if you look at telephones . The Sony telephone has a scroll button which is very useful in searching names or  Speaker marketing expert: but I don't think there are many T_V_s that can switch channels that fast . And so you would need like the T_V_ would need an a function where you can actually view all channels and scroll through it . Speaker industrial designer: If we're gonna focus on elderly people they'll have to adapt . So perhaps we should s stick to the basic layout . Speaker project manager: I think it's very important in the in the design . You can make a very fancy design with putting the buttons on the right places . Speaker marketing expert: But I don't think  I think if you're gonna make a remote control only to operate a T_V_ , you there's not much you can gain on having as few buttons as possible . Speaker project manager: you suggest we could better focus on for example the docking station . Speaker marketing expert: I think , mean we obviously need a good way to position all the buttons But I don't think we should spend very much time in that . Speaker project manager: Do you think the docking station will is allowed in the budget we have ? Speaker industrial designer: And if the remote stays rather small , it should be possible we're just gonna focus on the extras ? Speaker project manager: I think so . Speaker marketing expert: fifty percent of the people indicated that remote control tended to get lost . Speaker project manager: So maybe we should implement the audio sign , or something . Speaker industrial designer: Like with your key-chain , if you whistle it goes it makes a sound . Speaker marketing expert: you have it's on some phones too , which have a docking station . And you just press a button and the phone goes ringing . Speaker project manager: point is the L_C_D_ screen .  another I don't know if that will rise the cost too much , Speaker industrial designer: I think we'll have to choose between the docking station or the screen , Speaker marketing expert: it might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it , which would explain a button if you press it . And it wouldn't have to be touchscreen or a very expensive screen , Speaker project manager: Just the L_C_D_ . That's a good idea . Few buttons , we talked about that . Docking station , L_C_D_ . general functions  And default materials . I think that's a good idea as well , Because I think what we're going to design now is for people above sixty , maybe . If we want a  with for example the the telephone for elderly people , we can target the real elderly people .  Now you're talking about sixty to eighty for example .

Speaker industrial designer: We could use the basic normal battery . a hand dynamo . there there are four options . But I don't think that's  really an option . solar cells . But not every room is very light Or the kinetic energy . Speaker marketing expert: And how exactly does the kinetic energy work ? Speaker industrial designer: y you basically shake your remote , and then it powers up . Speaker marketing expert: personally I don't think that older people like to shake their remote control before they use it . And besides that you mentioned it would make the docking station obsolete . And I think our docking station could be one of the marketing issues with which we can get great popularity for our product . you could insert the find the lost remote control function in there . Speaker user interface: it's just a small display so I believe it will run on one battery for six months or f or or more . Speaker project manager: I think elderly people just like to have everything in place . And I don't think they they like remotes just laying everywhere in their rooms . So maybe a docking station will help them give the remote a place . And also what you said . you can introduce voice recognition by finding back your remote . But I think it's more efficient and cheaper to put it in the docking station . So you have a but button on your docking station which you can push , and then it starts beeping . And then we can we can still use the voice recognition , but maybe then for only the the channels . Speaker marketing expert: I'm wondering what will the voice recognition mean for the production price ? Speaker industrial designer: I don't have any information on pricing . Speaker marketing expert: we also asked if w they would , if people would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . you can see here , our target group would not do that . So if that would increase the price for which we're selling our remote control I would greatly advise not to do it . Speaker industrial designer: But that would also go for the L_C_D_ screen then I guess . It's a bit higher percentage , Speaker marketing expert: here the question was , would you prefer it . And on top of that the L_C_D_ screen would help in making the remote control easier to use . And I think a voice recognition function would not make the remote control much easier to use . Speaker project manager: I personally think the L_C_D_ screen we wanna use , with the extra information , I think nobody has anything against it . Because it's just some extra information , Maybe we have to discard the voice recognition . If we don't have the voice recognition , it will it won't use a lot of energy to use .  in that case we could use kinetic energy , but I think just a simple battery which you can reload on a docking station is just as good . And much cheaper as well . Speaker industrial designer: And that's the best choice . Speaker project manager: let me just choose for the battery . That brings us to the chip . Speaker industrial designer: there isn't any choice there because we're using the the the the display . Speaker project manager: And then we get to the point of the case . if we wanna choose for wood or the black and grey . Or both ? wood is a lot more expensive to produce . but I think it will attract elderly people who wanna have something exclusive , Speaker marketing expert:   And I think most important factor there is the wooden colour . Speaker project manager: But with colour was a lot more expensive ? Or ? Speaker industrial designer: I'll have to research . Speaker project manager: It's a lot more difficult to to handle and to to get in the right shape . Speaker user interface: with mobile phones so like the Nokia mobile phones , when you can change the case of it . is it possible to make changeable case . you have just to make one standard remote control , Speaker project manager: I think that's a very good option . You can sell the cases . and then you can make them with colour . Black and grey , other colours as well . Speaker marketing expert: We would have to look carefully into the design though . Speaker project manager: Costs . Speaker marketing expert: I think w we should just , we should then just design one one remote , but it would have to be fancy with either the wood cover or the plastic one . Speaker project manager: everybody's okay with the changing covers ? I think that's a good good option . Speaker marketing expert: I heard our Industrial Designer talk about flat , single and double curved . Speaker industrial designer: the the general like most older remotes are flat , just straight . Speaker marketing expert: And what would single curved and double curved mean ? Speaker industrial designer: it would just only affect the form , for as far as I know .

What type of interface do we want to use ? Speaker user interface: we can just use the regular form of it , Speaker marketing expert: you said you wanted to put the changing channels button on the right side , so you could , so your thumb would be easily  I thought maybe we could just make one of those buttons on both the left and the right side . For left-handed users also . Speaker user interface: Is it possible to program it s so you got on the left side or on the right side buttons for for shifting u up and shifting up ? And on the other  o other side buttons for shifting , for for the sound ? Speaker marketing expert: but I'm not sure if that would be very good for the easy , ease of use . Speaker project manager: Can't we make  Can't we make a remote which you can flip over and use on the same No that's not gonna work . I guess . But is it a problem that left-handed persons use a different hand ? I think the functions are that basic that nobody should have any problems with choosing a channel I think we could just leave it a normal shape . Speaker industrial designer: Let's look at the flat case . The the single curved so I'm not really sure what they're gonna look like , but I think it's something like this . or better  Should prevent repetitive strain injury a bit . this type should be better for you Speaker project manager: I suggest the single curved , because maybe the curve is pretty good to put the the screen in . Speaker user interface: the remote control have to lay in your hand . bit like so in the form of your hand . And to put the the buttons for changing the channel over here  Speaker project manager: But I think it's better to put the screen on top . Speaker marketing expert: And I'd prefer the corners to be round . Speaker user interface: But the on-off button , still on the top  Speaker project manager: Then  We've got a general idea of the concepts and the materials we're going to use .",

Then there's the zero to  one to zero buttons . A button for teletext . A button for the subtitles . And the company logo . So it's rather simple prototype .

Speaker industrial designer: I think if you look at most controls , they've got more buttons than this . the on-off button , it's it's a necessity . The volume and channel buttons , you need you obviously need those those . The mute button could be replaced by pressing the volume-down button twice . I think the help button really is necessary because there's no other way to know when someone wants to know what a button does .

Speaker project manager: but I think it's all too difficult for old people .  Speaker user interface: just use when you wanna switch between channels all the time . I think f Especially for older peo elderly people use standard buttons . Yeah , the ten plus button . Just one one pressing , or quickly after each other . Speaker industrial designer: w wouldn't it be a problem to  Because you h have to be fast enough . Speaker user interface: But I think that's in the T_V_ as well . That's how the the T_V_ T_V_ handles it . So you have like a five seconds period to press those two buttons . Speaker marketing expert: It's the T_V_ who depends that it must be two seconds or three seconds or one second that you must type one or two . Speaker user interface: So if you have a universal T_V_ controller , you needed one button that has two stripes . Most things in modern T_V_s are also on the menu . So you also need a menu button . And then navigation  But we can integrate that with volume and previous and next , Speaker industrial designer: I I think you ha really have to divide between functions you often use , like m maybe switch channels and volume and k that kind of things , and the menu button . Because you n almost never use menu button . Speaker project manager: Maybe it's still still a good idea , I'm not sure . You'll also have to use a mute button I don't know where where you have to put it . Speaker user interface: now my personal preferences . using the standards , basic  I think that we should stand out unique , being unique with the design . So we have to , I dunno , make a different shape than usual . Speaker project manager: Does it have to be  it has to be with different colours Speaker marketing expert: Maybe we can give it out in different colours . Speaker project manager: It's like a iMac or something . Speaker marketing expert: That's fa That's fancy . That's fashion . Speaker project manager: But it looks cheap as well , because it's a small thing . Speaker user interface: maybe you can look at mobile phones . They they're designed very well . You think you can't make a T_V_ controller too small , 'cause then you will always lo always lose it . But well , I think that's a good example .",

And just with together with the back-lights b look will look very new . Speaker project manager: And you have the scroll button inside . Speaker user interface: Just together with the back-lights you'll get a totally new look . More like the M_P_ three player M_ P_ M_ P_ three player . No rubber buttons or something .

If we want to make it . Speaker project manager: I think it's okay if you just keep it a bit square . Speaker industrial designer: I d I don't know n something about ergonomic kind of fits-in-the-hand stuff . Speaker project manager: maybe maybe make the the the  wha what's it called scroll wheel . Make it in in yellow or something . Just like the colours of Real Reaction . We just we just skip the the the voca or was it the the speech recognition . Speaker user interface: do we s keep that ? Speaker project manager: But you'd definitely need a advanced chip .

Speaker marketing expert: But we don't have any f information about the cost . Speaker industrial designer: Yeah , I have I have some some information about the cost . But just a about the chip . Speaker user interface: our division has developed a new speech recognition feature , the integrated programmable sample sensor simple speaker u unit . This is a very small electronic unit , will give a standard answer after it recognise a question . Just  You say record , followed by your question sample , and after a few seconds the answer sample . it works like good morning remote control , and then the remote control says good morning . that's integrated in the chip , but if we use speech recognition , that will be in it as well . it it would be would be a good feature feature .",

So that's the first thing we I think we should pay less attention to teletext . the remote control should only be used for the television , otherwise the project becomes more complex , our current customers are within the age group of forty plus , and new product should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty , And a last point , but also very important , our corporate image should stay recognisable in our products , which means that our corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design . according to our agenda it's then time to take a decision on the remote control functions . Speaker user interface: you said it should only work with one appliance ? Speaker project manager: Yeah . Only be used for television . Speaker user interface: Then it should have on , off , Speaker industrial designer: Standby options , Speaker marketing expert: the basics then by a volume , channel , one till two zero numbers on it , Speaker user interface: A button where you can change from one number to two numbers . Speaker marketing expert: because some T_V_s , if you press the t one and then the two , it be between five secs it make twelve , I think it's easy to implement a button with a s s what which especially do that , and that's that's not relaxed Speaker industrial designer: But all the television makes use of those button where you first press that button and then press two digits to to get Speaker project manager: new product should reach a market with customers that are younger than forty , Speaker marketing expert: younger people have now , sixteen till to twenty five age , are f eighty one percent interested in L_C_D_ screen . Speaker industrial designer: But I think that that collides with our mission to make it very cheap . A touch screen probably even more . perhaps we should we should focus on that L_C_D_ screen . Speaker marketing expert: you don't know how much it costs , the L_C_D_ screen . I don't have any costs here , Speaker user interface: But if you would do an L_C_D_ screen do we have don don't you have any buttons ? Speaker industrial designer: for example if you wanted the minimal use b buttons , such as channel and volume , you just h displays four buttons on the screen and it's possible to p press them down , just like a touch screen . Speaker project manager: we're going for an L_C_D_ screen ? Speaker marketing expert: I think it's the most easier thing , Speaker user interface: but also on the older , But he also said that we should not only focus on the younger people , and will they use it if it only has an L_C_D_ screen ? Speaker marketing expert: But our our our what's it , project requirements are the new products should be reached for new markets , to customers that are younger than forty . but market share fro for for forty years and younger is higher than that of sixty five and younger . if it costs  gets too much , too expensive , then yeah , we should be sticking to rubber buttons . Speaker industrial designer: I think that that they will send you some information about the cost of L_C_D_ screens . if you you receive an email about that , can you post it in the  Speaker project manager: But for now it's L_C_D_ . Okay . Speaker marketing expert: it'll look fancy with L_C_D_ screen .  Yeah .  Speaker user interface: They think it's ugly . When it has an L_C_D_ screen . Speaker marketing expert: Only thing you have to do is wipe the screen off once each time , to get all the fingerprints off it . Speaker project manager: what else does our remote need ? Speaker user interface: A mute button . Speaker marketing expert:  The most important things on a f on an on an remote control are channel selection , volume con selection , and power s power usage . And a teletext , but that is not of the question . Speaker user interface: But shouldn't you put a button of  for teletext on the  for the people who want to use it ?

Speaker marketing expert: And other other less important things are screen settings , audio settings , and channel settings , Speaker user interface: they are less important , but I think they should be there , Speaker industrial designer: but in a sub sub-menu or something like that . I think it's also important to make it possible to how do you call it in English , , to not use batteries , Speaker user interface: Perhaps you should be able to to switch the control off . Speaker marketing expert: power supply is one of the most important things . Speaker user interface: If you have an L_C_D_ screen that's burns all the time I dunno . Speaker marketing expert: because I don't think people will like it who who that you have to turn it on first and then use it , so I think it's better when th the T_V_ shuts down , the remote shuts down . Speaker industrial designer: And go to standby mode when you don't use it , Speaker project manager: And maybe a low battery indicator ? On the screen . Speaker marketing expert: of put it in a recharger . Charger . Speaker project manager: So we are going for the for the recharger . Speaker user interface: I think the batteries should should w should work a lot longer than a couple of days , Speaker industrial designer: it should be a standard move to to put your remote control in the charger when you're done watching television , that's also a a a great advantage because you can't lose it anymore . Speaker user interface:  But then you also have to s have somewhere where you can put a remo recharger near your couch because otherwise you have to walk a long way when you twoft want to turn on the T_V_ . Speaker industrial designer: just a cable , or a even a a a a a charger where you can mount it on . Something like that , Functional designs for the elderly you could make it possible to enlarge the screen , so make it possible to not display a button at ten points Speaker marketing expert: I think that this should be standard . Large button  large buttons . Speaker project manager: And you said something about speech recognition ? Speaker marketing expert: also ninety one percent sixteen to twenty five , twenty six to thirty five years , seventy six percent , and thirty six to forty five , thirty five percent . Speaker user interface: twelve fifty , twelve fifty .  I know let's do a speech .  But they want to talk into the remo remote control , or something , Speaker marketing expert:  I think an L_C_D_ screen  should be suf sufficient . Speaker project manager: But when you look at the percentages  but nobody knows how much it will cost . Speaker marketing expert: I think I think it's better to have L_ L_C_D_ screen , Speaker project manager: But would it be useful to imple implement both ? Speaker marketing expert: Yeah , if the costs al allow it .  Speaker user interface: but how would you like to implement that , that you say volume up , and then it goes up , Speaker industrial designer: Certain systems already exist , I think . Speaker user interface: Then you also have to have different languages if we go international . Speaker marketing expert: But that should also be with f should be also with L_C_D_ screen . Speaker user interface: you can use icons Speaker industrial designer: it should be done . If it could be done , should be done . Speaker project manager: so we only do this when we have enough money left . I've written down an an on or off button , volume selection , channel selection , the digits from one to zero , huh .  or from zero to nine . a digits button to switch between one and two digits , mute button , a separate menu for teletext , a battery indicator . And the possibility to enlarge buttons or to have large buttons Speaker user interface: You also now have colours . Speaker marketing expert: Curved ? Speaker project manager: so not too much teletext support , but in a separate menu , Speaker marketing expert: We could check the other remote controls with technical functions . Speaker project manager: Aren't we forgetting something very important ? Speaker marketing expert: wide screen , high screen , different things you have , it should be available , but then in separate screen settings or something . Channel settings . Or it could be possible to have a a standard version of the remote , an expanded version . Speaker user interface: and the buttons , should they have colours ? Speaker industrial designer: Colours I think the main colour of the remote control is the colour of the L_C_D_ screen . Speaker user interface: Perhaps you can make adjustable fronts , like with the telephones  . Speaker industrial designer: make it available in different colours , you mean ? Speaker project manager: we're having a a general menu with the most used functions , teletext , screen settings , audio settings , channel settings , Speaker user interface: Or do we have any buttons ? On the remote . Speaker marketing expert: you only have channel button or volume button . Speaker user interface: So we don't have any normal buttons But that's also in the L_C_D_ , Speaker marketing expert: Maybe only the on and o on and off button . Speaker user interface: But isn't idea to use what you said , normal on and off button for the T_V_ , But a not as normal button , in the L_C_D_ , Speaker project manager: maybe there should be a separate button apart from the L_C_D_ , There has to be a on button on the remote , Speaker user interface: No you just tap I think . Speaker industrial designer: because when you touch the L_C_D_ screen when it is in standby mode , it should pop on . Speaker user interface: I guess if you use the L_C_D_ screen , you first have to search where is the on button , But if you have a normal on button on the on the remote , then you do the on , Speaker industrial designer: I think it looks a lot more fancy if you use if you don't have any buttons on the s on on remote control . Speaker project manager: So actually we're going to create a a button-less remote . No buttons at all . that's might be a unique selling point , huh for a remote . postpone further discussion to our next meeting ,",

Speaker industrial designer: Components design , first of all I've d subtracted some of the components that is that are used are w w  you know from what the remote control's formed . first of all , the case , the case , the surrounding of the of the the remote control . the case was is made from rubber , I suppose . because when you use a remote control a lot of people will will drop their remote control the titanium was also an option . But it's a very expensive material . rubber is , I think , the best suitable material to use for our it's poss it's also possible to create fancy colours with rubber . titanium you have to paint it and with that it's possible to scratch it  I h I had an idea single covered curved , sorry , single curved . it's t two dimensional . I think it's it's best to draw I thought of an idea like this . So it also looks nice when it's on your table . it doesn't lay flat down on the table , but it's c it's stands . the graphical user interface and the buttons , we also thought about that already . I thought about the L_C_D_ touch screen , And it should be made of strong plastic and it should be bright . this should be our button component . the batteries , we also thought about that already , And they should be long lasting , not not be empty in about two minutes or thirty minutes or forty minutes of use . there was an option to use s a rather simple chip but I think because of our highly requiring requirements , there should be an advanced chip in it with also the ability to facilitate speaker speech recognition there should be some more investigation on that side . I also overheard in the last meeting that there shou we should use our own business colours . I think they are rather boring for for use with rubber . Speaker project manager: but I don't think you have to make the entire thing in the corporate colour .  Speaker industrial designer: We could make a little R_ and R_  on the top of the machine . I suggest , because just the availability with rubber to make fantastic colours and also in a lot of possible colours , so it's possible to make very fancy remote controls but i if you drop it it's not broken right away s instead of using plastic , hard plastic or titanium . s as I said before rubber is is impossible to damage severely",

And  we determined that will not be no buttons , but only an L_C_D_ screen , first there are some new findings and new technology for speech recognition . And this is that you you ask you give a question through through the device and it answers you . And they already put this in an in a coffee maker . This and there's an easy way to program that perhaps it's useful , perhaps for because people lose the remote , they can yell remote where are you and  calls or something . And then I have to go out of the presentation because I tried to make some kind of a a idea of how it should look like And perhaps we could implement that . I tried to the L_C_D_ screen I tried to sort of to draw  . I thought at least the icon for the volume . and then the buttons above and below the and the and the mute button also recognisable as an icon . I think it's not really on scale and and so forth . an options button . It's options is the settings of the remote and of the T_V_ and that kind of thing . Perhaps we could be more curvy the remote perhaps should , so that it's better in your hand or something . But and and a microph microphone for the speech recognition if we want to implement that . and then if you press the op options button , now we have an example of and then you should get the other options with what what you could do And it's also I thought think we discussed earlier that older people don't really want to use these extra settings .

I think like my colleague , you said , is that's e better , or for the elderly people something like like the iPod or something , with round squares . Speaker user interface: You could you could change the colours , that was also the idea . Speaker project manager: I guess changing colours will be easier than changing Speaker industrial designer: Changing just the shape of the remote control ? Speaker user interface: Perhaps you could find something in the middle . Speaker industrial designer: round corners , but s but square , yeah . Speaker project manager: But maybe then both groups won't buy it . Speaker industrial designer: and the L_C_D_ screen was rather small . . Speaker marketing expert: w I think that L_C_D_ screen should be like  Speaker industrial designer: but I think it should be larger . Yeah , three quarters . Speaker marketing expert: Larger I think . Speaker user interface: Looks a bit like a Game Boy now .  So it's a bit square , but it's also a bit round . Speaker marketing expert:  Look something like that  . Autumn colours like red , brown . So maybe we could give it like wooden loo look look or something in that colour . between the young people ? Fresh , exciting . And the old people , old and boring . like I said , young people like more soft materials and spongy ones So we have to decide if we're going to use real hard rubber , or soft rubber . Or something something between that . Speaker industrial designer: Soft rubber . Speaker marketing expert: like like like a a eraser or something . That's the bit you can press it in , Yeah it's quite hard but you can press it in . Speaker user interface: So we should first decide about shape , I think . Speaker industrial designer: but if yo if you make the the L_C_D_ screen as large as the remote control itself , you'll  you'll always get some  Speaker user interface: You always touch it , Speaker marketing expert: because you have how much ? Nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen buttons on the screen . Because some fat people with d thick fingers will press three buttons at same time . Speaker project manager: And we won't include a a pen , or something to point , we we want to do it with our fingers , Speaker industrial designer: Because if you lose the pen if you lose the pen you can't use  Speaker user interface: Yeah o yeah  , if they think it's handy to use a pen . Speaker project manager: And maybe we have to add a tissue to remove the grease from all the fingers , huh .  Speaker marketing expert: but that that can be  with plain soft tissue . Speaker industrial designer: And the case , yeah we already discussed the case , we wanted to make it from rubber Speaker user interface: but but a hard rubber like this ? Or softer rubber Speaker industrial designer: hard rubber I think . Speaker marketing expert: We have different colours . the shapes is something between the square shapes with round colo corners and a round shapes ? I think it's more round than square .  Speaker user interface: But I think it should be a bit longer , perhaps . Speaker marketing expert: I think it meets more the young people than the older people . Speaker project manager: But that's what we want ,  . Speaker industrial designer: and how about my idea of making it with one single curve ? Speaker marketing expert: I thought that was a quite good Speaker industrial designer: got a single curved rubber what's the standard colour ? Speaker marketing expert: we have different colour . Speaker user interface: You should you should have a black one because I think black is standard . Speaker marketing expert: Dark grey , something like this this colour or something . I think it's better to have silver nowadays . Yeah the the silver black are our main colours . Yeah . Speaker project manager: w what about a yellow thing , Speaker marketing expert: it'll be a banana yellow , we have . Green , wood , brown . Speaker industrial designer: But if you use silver , rubber s silver rubber isn't fancy .

Speaker industrial designer: Chip on print with a with a  simple a sim not a simple but a  Speaker project manager: but how did this how does that with a L_C_D_ screen ? You still have a print plate . Speaker marketing expert: I dunno what w what we have to decide about that . Speaker industrial designer: chip on print , I think what they mean with the regular rubber buttons that you got , it's always clear for the remote control when you press a certain button . But when you got a L_C_D_ screen , with no with not   the buttons are not always on the same place , Speaker marketing expert: but the p print plate of L_ L_C_D_ screen is more advanced than a normal print plate , Speaker project manager: you need some kind of C_P_U_ , I guess . Speaker marketing expert: , I don't I dunno I don't think that's  Yeah , it's quite a simple L_C_D_ screen . I think they don't need that big of C_P_U_ . Speaker industrial designer: but it the the remote control has to know whether you're in a settings menu or just you just want to turn up the volume . So it has to have some kind of a calculation unit or C_P_U_ Speaker project manager: Because we're projecting projecting the buttons on the L_C_D_ screen . there are also some some questions about the concepts I think Speaker user interface: what we should also have on , I just remembered , a menu to go back through the first  if if you touch options , you can't go back to this right away now . Speaker marketing expert: Isn't it better to have the sound and the general buttons horizontal ? Speaker industrial designer: If you make the screen vertical it doesn't matter . Speaker marketing expert: I think it's it's easier to have it something like  Oh a button minus here , plus over here . A minus here , plus over here . The other buttons and on here  the top . Speaker user interface: I think I would put a plus and a min here . And then the P_ in the mid in the middle Speaker industrial designer: We'll leave that to the usability engineering then .  Speaker user interface: But I'm going to look if I've got some examples Speaker industrial designer: So not how much  n not how often it's used , but  Speaker user interface: W what's what's usual or normal . Speaker marketing expert: because I have two televisions at home . One is horizontal , one is vertical , Speaker industrial designer: it does it doesn't really matter , Speaker project manager: I think we have we don't have to decide about that now Speaker user interface: And the speech shall we implement that ? But then you should also find a place  You could if you do it like this you could put it in a corner or something . Speaker industrial designer: you can make a very sensitive microphone , Speaker project manager: maybe at the bottom where you can can hel hold it with you hand that there's also a microphone Speaker industrial designer: But that's not import I think that's not im very important Speaker user interface: You could p you could put it in a logo of the company .  Speaker marketing expert: between the round of the R_ . Speaker industrial designer: but it doesn't makes it any more fancy because you get to see  Speaker user interface: just 'cause other remotes don't have that . Speaker project manager: because a microphone is very small thing , but you can make it look like it's big so as its its really an important function of the remote . we already s discussed that , huh , the the L_C_D_ Speaker industrial designer:  Interface type . Speaker marketing expert: I think it's better to just  up what you'd like to do on the screen . If you want to go back you have to back button go back , if you want to choose audio settings you press audio settings and it goes to that s sub-menu . Speaker user interface: the the young people do like scroll and I think you can never get through a menu great with a scroll  Speaker marketing expert: I think the scroll's easier if you have a lot of options , Speaker industrial designer: you get w when you use the settings menu for example to look up some some channels on your on your television , you should scroll scroll down on a menu which probably does not fit on your screen .

Questionnaire with seven point scale from one to seven , from true to false , like question , is remote big enough , we can say it's true or it's false by steps . One means absolutely not true , seven   means true . is the remote control fancy enough , is it in innovative enough , and is it easy enough to use . Is the design fancy enough ? Speaker project manager: it's  looks fancy , especially with the green colour . And the the curves which we decided , Only what happened to the single curve we spoke about last meeting ? Speaker user interface: It  oh it's in the background . Oh . it would be something like this from the side , but with a bit of curve here , Speaker industrial designer: it's also very handy if you make a side curve way to make the the remote control very thin at the bottom at a bottom at a bottom . make it rather thick on the top , because on the top it has the screen , Speaker marketing expert: Isn't going to be a little bit heavy at the top ? Speaker user interface: I think yeah , the battery should be in here , Speaker marketing expert: fancy enough means , does it comes to the younger people and the elder people . Speaker user interface: I if you don't make it green , then the elder people won't won't like it . Speaker marketing expert: all the colour colours don don doesn't matter that m that much now , Speaker project manager: I think especially because of the microphone and the L_C_D_ screen also . Speaker user interface: Alright , it's a one .  Oh it's a one .  Speaker marketing expert: Yeah , I think two . Speaker industrial designer: It's very fancy , I think . Speaker user interface: I think it is , because it has an L_C_D_ screen , a mi microphone . Speaker industrial designer: And the scroll is rubber , Speaker marketing expert: Also huh uh-huh  the buttons , are they easy to find ? Speaker user interface: Yeah , because they're right on your screen . The options are it  little bit harder , Speaker industrial designer: It's easier than the regular remote control . Speaker marketing expert: I think th I think the options buttons are not the the easiest way to to Speaker industrial designer: where you have to find out what  which sign or icon means on every button . So you have t you have to use the the the manual to understand most  Speaker project manager: A two , okay , Speaker marketing expert: I personally think , because I d I don't think i maybe it's easy to use , I I think if you have the button at the right , I don't think you can find the option button that easy . but you have y then you have here s written option on here , the teletext button , It's easy to use , as well for younger as elderl elderly people . Is it innovative ? Speaker user interface: For young people I think it's easy to use . Speaker industrial designer: I think it's the most useful remote control ever to be manufactured .  Speaker project manager: As well for the for the older people ? Speaker marketing expert: Yeah , as well Speaker user interface: but they they don't want the extra options , Speaker project manager: And would it be easy for them to use the speech recognition ? Speaker user interface: I think it is . If they read a manual . You say you say record to to the to the speech recognition , then you say the question and the answer . And that's everything it does , the speech recognition . Speaker project manager: maybe that would make it even more easy to use for them . a three , Speaker marketing expert: Remotes overwhelmed with buttons . Tha that's a one , I think , that's definitely a one . Speaker project manager: but I think you should make it one scale with with one being good and seven being bad , Speaker marketing expert: I think isn't , this has to be something like isn't overwhelmed . Speaker project manager: because otherwise we can't calculate anything from the results , Speaker marketing expert: Remote control has colours that different  that meet different target groups . Speaker user interface: 'Cause we make them in different colours , Speaker project manager: but you can also make a wood colour , not just one single colour but a wood-like thing , and I though w we had about single colours , Speaker marketing expert: Also with rubber ? Speaker project manager: You can make a print on rubber , Speaker marketing expert:  The material used is spongy , that that's that's a one , Speaker user interface: Yeah , yeah , it's very spongy . I think it's a three . Speaker industrial designer: because you want to make it rather flexible but not too flexible , Speaker marketing expert: Remote control is hard to lose . Speaker industrial designer: yeah it sh and it's easy to find . Speaker marketing expert: Y you can't you can't lose it if you're sixty years old . I think I think this is a two , personally . Speaker project manager: So it should  this question should be hard to lose . It's difficult to lose it . Speaker user interface: so then this is  it is almost true , Speaker marketing expert: Remote control mainly be sold to younger people . Speaker user interface: I think it will , Speaker marketing expert: No , I don't think very true because the colours . I think it's a three . Speaker project manager: because w we designed it for young people especially , Speaker marketing expert: Because younger peoples are cr critical and they wanted a lot of features on this thing . Speaker industrial designer: n not exactly but if it had some games on it or something like that , Speaker user interface: I think they like the speech .

Speaker marketing expert: the L_C_D_  touch screen is feature . The microphone is a feature . Speaker user interface: No , aren't the features  and that you can change the channel's feature , Speaker marketing expert: I think it's it's it's a one . you have all buttons on it which you'd like , microphone extra , L_C_D_ screen extra , scroll thing extra . You can see the remote control is  R_ and R_ . Speaker user interface: Yeah , there's R_ and R_ in front .  it's not the colour , so maybe you should make two , Speaker marketing expert: you have the black one . And we'll probably make also a yellow one . Speaker user interface: but not R_ and R_ yellow I think .

And the the curves which we decided , Only what happened to the single curve we spoke about last meeting ? Speaker user interface: It  oh it's in the background . Oh . it would be something like this from the side , but with a bit of curve here , Speaker industrial designer: it's also very handy if you make a side curve way to make the the remote control very thin at the bottom at a bottom at a bottom . make it rather thick on the top , because on the top it has the screen , Speaker marketing expert: Isn't going to be a little bit heavy at the top ? Speaker user interface: I think yeah , the battery should be in here , Speaker marketing expert: fancy enough means , does it comes to the younger people and the elder people . Speaker user interface: I if you don't make it green , then the elder people won't won't like it . Speaker marketing expert: all the colour colours don don doesn't matter that m that much now , Speaker project manager: I think especially because of the microphone and the L_C_D_ screen also . Speaker user interface: Alright , it's a one .  Oh it's a one .  Speaker marketing expert: Yeah , I think two . Speaker industrial designer: It's very fancy , I think . Speaker user interface: I think it is , because it has an L_C_D_ screen , a mi microphone . Speaker industrial designer: And the scroll is rubber , Speaker marketing expert: Also huh uh-huh  the buttons , are they easy to find ? Speaker user interface: Yeah , because they're right on your screen . The options are it  little bit harder , Speaker industrial designer: It's easier than the regular remote control . Speaker marketing expert: I think th I think the options buttons are not the the easiest way to to Speaker industrial designer: where you have to find out what  which sign or icon means on every button . So you have t you have to use the the the manual to understand most  Speaker project manager: A two , okay , Speaker marketing expert: I personally think , because I d I don't think i maybe it's easy to use , I I think if you have the button at the right , I don't think you can find the option button that easy . but you have y then you have here s written option on here , the teletext button , Speaker user interface: For young people I think it's easy to use . Speaker industrial designer: I think it's the most useful remote control ever to be manufactured .  Speaker project manager: As well for the for the older people ? Speaker marketing expert: Yeah , as well Speaker user interface: but they they don't want the extra options , Speaker project manager: And would it be easy for them to use the speech recognition ? Speaker user interface: I think it is . If they read a manual . You say you say record to to the to the speech recognition , then you say the question and the answer . And that's everything it does , the speech recognition . Speaker project manager: maybe that would make it even more easy to use for them . a three , Speaker marketing expert: Tha that's a one , I think , that's definitely a one . Speaker project manager: but I think you should make it one scale with with one being good and seven being bad , Speaker marketing expert: I think isn't , this has to be something like isn't overwhelmed . Speaker project manager: because otherwise we can't calculate anything from the results , Speaker user interface: 'Cause we make them in different colours , Speaker project manager: but you can also make a wood colour , not just one single colour but a wood-like thing , and I though w we had about single colours , Speaker marketing expert: Also with rubber ? Speaker project manager: You can make a print on rubber , Speaker marketing expert: that that's that's a one , Speaker user interface: Yeah , yeah , it's very spongy . I think it's a three . Speaker industrial designer: because you want to make it rather flexible but not too flexible , Speaker marketing expert: Remote control is hard to lose . Speaker industrial designer: yeah it sh and it's easy to find . Speaker marketing expert: Y you can't you can't lose it if you're sixty years old . I think I think this is a two , personally . Speaker project manager: So it should  this question should be hard to lose . It's difficult to lose it . Speaker user interface: so then this is  it is almost true , I think it will , Speaker marketing expert: No , I don't think very true because the colours . I think it's a three . Speaker project manager: because w we designed it for young people especially , Speaker marketing expert: Because younger peoples are cr critical and they wanted a lot of features on this thing . Speaker industrial designer: n not exactly but if it had some games on it or something like that , Speaker user interface: I think they like the speech . Speaker marketing expert: L_C_D_ screen and scroll . Speaker project manager: It has relatively few features , Speaker user interface: those are features . Speaker marketing expert: the L_C_D_  touch screen is feature . The microphone is a feature . Speaker user interface: No , aren't the features  and that you can change the channel's feature , Speaker marketing expert: I think it's it's it's a one . you have all buttons on it which you'd like , microphone extra , L_C_D_ screen extra , scroll thing extra .

Speaker user interface: And I think we should lose the curve . Speaker marketing expert: I think we should scrap the sample speaker . Speaker user interface: then it will  won't stand up from the table . Could could we do it on a regular chip on print or something ? Speaker marketing expert: otherwise we don't have an L_C_D_ screen . Scrap sample speaker ? Speaker project manager: you should you should drop the speech recognition . And then you can keep the curve . Or make it on a hand dynamo , but  I don't think that will work . Speaker marketing expert: Ma make it with wood instead of rubber ? Speaker user interface:  We could make it titanium instead of rubber . What is special colour ? Is that the wood wood  Speaker marketing expert: I think it is . Speaker project manager: But I think the only option is to drop the sample speaker . Speaker user interface: Th then we still have too much Speaker marketing expert: three . Point three . Speaker industrial designer: Let's make it thirteen or fourteen .  Speaker marketing expert: That's a scroll wheel .  Speaker user interface: Don't make it wood . Speaker marketing expert: we can make it brown , dark brown , not wood . Speaker user interface: a all kind of colours ? Speaker industrial designer: special colours , fruity colours . Speaker user interface: but it's a special colour than just rubber colour . You have to add something to the rubber to make it green . Speaker marketing expert: then we have to scrap everything we got Speaker industrial designer: If we lose the scroll wheel and make it totally depending dependent on the touch screen  then it's possible to make . How d how many colours ? Speaker marketing expert: but we we we are  we have yellow , red , black , titanium . Speaker user interface: But I think when you use the colour that's not originally the rubber then you use special colour , Speaker marketing expert: but we're gonna make it yellow  red , and then you add  you have two special colours on top of the one we have now . I  then I think I p I don I don't think they me mean they're special  Speaker industrial designer: You don't need four of those  four of those special colours in one in one remote .

And of course solar cells . for the a case , there's the traditional uncurved flat hard case . Single curved , which means that it has curves in one dimension .

So  So we only , we already decided that kinetic would be the choice for energy . do you have a picture of doubly curved case ? Speaker user interface: This is the the menu I was looking at . Speaker industrial designer: S see this is the the the standard traditional type , where the form yeah serves the function , you know . But this m is more appealing to old people and we don't want that . And th that means curved in both dire dire dimensions . where your thumbs would be laying in the instrument and it has to be nice to hold . And  Speaker user interface: Th this looks a little bit like like for only for children . So  Speaker industrial designer: Yeah but that's that's the the problem yeah the dilemma actually , 'cause we wanna appeal to the to the young public with fancy with flashy colours , and with a lot of shape . Yeah , and the and the rubber , it it will look cheap always , Speaker user interface: Okay but the the colours , you you can make it make the colours with  LEDs beneath the the buttons . If you press a button and you can disable the the colour LEDs for for people that don't like it . Speaker industrial designer: And this is , this is with the curved that I mean . Speaker project manager: Well we could make a compromise between that . instead of doubly curved we take a single curved . So to appeal a little more to the all the public . Speaker marketing expert: Yeah so we keep it singly c single curved then ? Speaker industrial designer: I would go for the double curved . I mean our aim is to make something different right ? And I I'm I'm thinking you know a drawing palette , where you have the shape for your thumb . Speaker user interface: but if you if you make it more curved we we can make more and more options for buttons . Speaker industrial designer: You can make a trigger button or something like that . and we need something that well that  that you can able to use in one hand I think . Speaker marketing expert: But from the side you you can have it also in a kind of shape . A little upwards . So that the screen is more So then you have double double curved in some way . Speaker industrial designer: How about we do a a pop-up screen , like the laptop . Speaker project manager: If you can flip . Speaker marketing expert: But I dunno if that's too expensive . Speaker project manager: Okay so the buttons are on top here , and you flip it over that way . and you can maybe even drop the menu button because maybe if you flip it open it will auto activate amauto automatically . Speaker marketing expert: So  okay b but you have t you need some button to flip this open . Speaker industrial designer: Well yeah the the idea of it was , is that because you close it , you cover the L_C_D_ screen and it won't be vulnerable to scratches or whatever . We just have to make sure that the closing mechanism won't break .  or do we wanna make its shape look like a banana or something ? Speaker project manager: I think that it's a nice design . Speaker marketing expert: Yeah so okay we should better choose one sh one shape . Speaker project manager: So the keywords are primary co colours , spongey ? And ergonomical shape . Yeah . Speaker industrial designer: I would give it a female shape Speaker marketing expert: I don't know what what colours should the basic print be like ? Like some soft  green or something ? Speaker project manager: Orange or something . Speaker marketing expert: and then and then very bright , a yellow banana ,  an orange , a green apple , stuff like that , Speaker industrial designer: Yeah w we need very primary colours , like bright red , bright yellow . Speaker user interface: Yeah but the primary colours w we can create with the with the LEDs on the on the remote control . If you make it just a yeah bl give it a blue colour , then it's just a neutral colour , Speaker marketing expert: So that's that's a dark blue basic colour I guess . Yeah with some some yellow banana  Speaker industrial designer: 'cause I remember from one of our first meetings that people lose their remote controls often . So it  not not only in in the colours  of the LEDs , that we want something to keep it visible at all times , Speaker marketing expert: I mean , the the colour of the background of the display ? So just just a  a blue blue backlight or something like that . Speaker user interface: maybe a maybe a white a white backlight ? Speaker industrial designer: But don't we wanna make the background the the bright colo colours ? So th the total of the thing is very bright ? Speaker marketing expert: But then then again , which colour should the buttons be ? But maybe the buttons , all buttons in red is maybe a bad contrast for colourblind people . Speaker industrial designer:  Red and green are actually the b the easiest to discriminate . Even for colourblind . Speaker marketing expert: So red buttons are okay ? You better bet better better keep the LED and the button itself in the same colour I guess .

Well we evaluate the design with a seven point scale , as following . Well the criteria are based on the user requirements , the trends from the marketing research , and the marketing strategy of the company itself . And we all have to agree on a certain level . Well the first point is the remote control matches the operating behaviour of the young user . Speaker industrial designer:  I think it does . Because the operating  behaviour of the young user was also defined in colour and shape and the use of L_C_D_ , Speaker marketing expert: Okay well I say still two , but it has to be three then . The remote control has irrelevant or less used functions .  Yeah . Well , yeah . So it it's a very true point . I mean it hides all those function . It shows the relevant and most used functions . Speaker industrial designer: It automatically has the the programme and the volume function , Okay five . Speaker marketing expert: the the remote control makes use of technolog technological innovation like L_C_D_ screen and speech recognition . Speaker project manager: Yeah , I say two .

Speaker project manager: So not a not a remote control who which can can be used for television and a D_V_D_ and radio Speaker marketing expert: most of the remote c remote controls are just for one purpose . And by making it multi-purpose , it has a new feature , adds a new feature to the market , and distinguish from from current products . maybe some other technology than infrared . I rather find it very annoying , like when someone is standing in front of the T_V_ then you can't switch it .  think about sending it over radio waves or bluetooth .

Furthermore they all have a a very simple structure , 'cause well we we should be able to build a relatively cheap  a cheap remote . because  well my personal opinion is is not to do Bluetooth  or or radio waves , Speaker marketing expert: What do you think about incorporating Bluetooth or a radio receiver in the place-holder next to the T_V_ , connected to the T_V_ ?

And well one of the ideas was maybe use touch screen , but s I don't know in how far that is possible , since we are sticking to infrared and and the remote cannot receive anything , but we might consider that . So just keep it simple , make clear buttons , easy to use . I prefer to use it only for T_V_ and and if possible , the buttons should give  a dr direct action , not first select  Speaker project manager: you you just said you wanted to to combine more functions in one , Speaker user interface: and so that's where the difficulties lie . Do we want to use a few options and might not be so or original , or multi-purpose as we thought , or do we want to use many buttons . Speaker marketing expert: it's maybe an option if you use an L_C_D_  or a touch screen , that in the middle are the the main keys , just in the middle the general functions , like play , channel switching , and then at the top or at the bottom , some menus like settings or  that you can drop down . Speaker user interface: Do we want to use a menu display on the T_V_ ? Or does have to f everything be in remotes ? 'Cause if you use a memory display on the T_V_ , you can simply push a more menu and then select the options you want to have and press okay . if you use many options in one buttle  button , display the menu on the T_V_ and don't use combination of t of two buttons at the same time or pressing buttons three times for five seconds , is too complicated for most users . Speaker marketing expert: and when you have a particular menu at your device , it could be that don't correspond to the menu what's actually on T_V_ . Speaker industrial designer: you have to keep in mind that not all d not  our remote won't be able to work on all televisions .

Speaker user interface:  especially the important buttons , if you want to switch channel , change your volume , use teletext , it it has to work at once and more advanced options may be put it s somewhere away on the remote , behind a little little thing or a touch screen . Speaker marketing expert: I think the idea about touch screen is very good . , because recently I saw news item on T_V_ about new telephones for elder people . , they have like a touch screen with really big pictures on it like call hang-up , because one the one hand you make the remote control compatible for elder users just by scaling up the pictures or something . Speaker user interface: make a remote that fits easily in the hands Speaker marketing expert: then what's gonna be displayed on the touch screen ? Speaker industrial designer: The extra functions . Speaker user interface: you you just see a menu from system functions or teletext functions , and you just choose one , Speaker industrial designer:  Wouldn't it be better to make just one big touch screen , one one small touch screen applet and we have three of those , actually just menus with sub-menus , with  or sub-items , sub-functions . Speaker user interface: then I'd like to make a proposal . If you make one big touch screen , keep the buttons always available and use the lower part of the touch screen for the rest . Speaker project manager: So you think it's will be better to have a t kinda total touch screen . Speaker user interface: that they always make the same buttons accessible , so use just for special options a part of the touch screen . an elder parents or grandparent picks up the remote from the little child and who's all in the systems functions , you'll have to have the possibility to turn off the T_V_ or to switch the channel without well using all the menu structures to get back to the primary functions . Speaker marketing expert: I had another idea about maybe parental control . , like building in some kind of PIN code  if children don't don't know the PIN code , they can't switch to violent channels or  Speaker user interface: Is that possible to use or no ? Speaker industrial designer: that actually depends on the television , thing is when you buy a remote , you you set the channels , the the channels are different on each te television , Speaker marketing expert: th th those things are nice .  Speaker project manager: but I think that's we wel  later in the stage . because I think elderly people may be not used to a touch screen , so they want the the the normal functions like teletext , volume changing , to be , yeah , kinda traditionals and  the the the the other functions , the more difficult functions to be maybe on the touch screen , Speaker marketing expert: but but if you display it on L_C_D_ screen with r r really big numbers Speaker user interface: You can display actual buttons on the touch screens . Speaker industrial designer: but well we have to look at what's our target audience . W we are aiming for younger people Speaker marketing expert: And th those young people , yeah . Y you saw it in my marketing report , they like the new fancy stuff , A touch screen , like Microsoft al already developed something like that for multi-media applications . I th I think we can do that too . Speaker project manager: th the the main points in this in this meeting is I think how it's going to look we must keep it simple , but have the opportunity to have more options and have them hidden or something , the functions , know , like the menus or the the parental control must be all by the  done by the remote control and not by the television . Speaker user interface: then there's always , there are always possibilities to change the colour and the brightness and the volume and well maybe we can look out if there's options that the remote in its memory can see what kinda T_V_ it is , there are universal d remotes and they all have a functionality for all the T_V_s , Speaker project manager: And it's not too complex to do it . Speaker industrial designer: they they all have to be programmed to fit your T_V_ and that that is bit of a tricky job . Speaker marketing expert: , with the current remote controls , the universal ones , you have to press  yeah , you have to press a code for T_V_ . Speaker user interface: In codes , y you you get a b a book with codes . if you look at the manuals from universal remotes , there are maybe three four hundreds T_V_s at maximum . If you have all of them , all the old and new T_V_s summed up , Speaker marketing expert: maybe we can incorporate some kind of U_S_B_ or a firewire connection , so that you can connect it to the P_C_ But , on the other hand on the other hand , if you have a remote and buy a new T_V_ that isn't incorporated in the remote  Speaker user interface: Well then you have to buy a new one , or an update , software update . Speaker industrial designer: Or you could  well you could s actually look at the place-holder you talked about earlier , then then it's be back to the building a receiving  well if it's actually worth it to build it in , it it would be bringing more costs  with with it Speaker user interface: m for which one are we going ?  Speaker industrial designer: my vote goes out to the right  . Speaker user interface: I was doubting about which one to take , but you've convinced me that if you di display buttons about the same as they would look on a normal remote all elderly people will know what to do .

Speaker project manager: Yeah , but you don't you don't actually need them , becau b l a lot of remote controls work that y when y that you when you fir you push the one first , then you have a couple of seconds  Speaker marketing expert: No , that's dependent on the television . Speaker project manager: I know some remote controls that don't have these buttons , but you still can , know , obviously you can still select the twenty  a number in the twenty or in the ten . Speaker marketing expert: Yes , but no remote control nowadays are   they come with the television . Speaker project manager: when when you put a button on it with like one and then a dash , it's the same thing as when you just push the one , Speaker industrial designer: some televisions don't accept that that  Speaker project manager: When you push the button , the remote control gives a signal . and when y whe when you don't push another button on the remote control within five seconds , then the remote control gives a signal for channel one . Speaker marketing expert: it it it works if you haven't got a special button for it , if you push a one , then on your television there will appear a one and a a line , which is an empty space . Speaker project manager: Yeah , but it's exact the same  that w would appear when you put a separate button  push a separate button . Speaker industrial designer: Yes , but some some old televisions you have to click on a special button , then you go to a a next level , you can push two buttons . Speaker project manager: Yeah , but you don't underst you don't understand my point . that special but button  you're talking about , eh ? That's just a signal to recei ju they send a t signal to the v tv T_V_ that they have to put a one in  on your screen and a dash , which you can pu so you can still put another number on it . When you don't have that separate button , and you push y one , it's exactly the same thing . Speaker marketing expert: No , s some some televisions need the input first and and you c Speaker project manager: That's the same thing as the button with the one and it  Speaker marketing expert: It's simply not true . It's simply not true .

I don't agree with the long box shape  Speaker industrial designer: But it does fit in the hand if you hold it like this , and you can make it another shape , Speaker user interface: No if y if you look at new Phillips D_V_D_  with their remotes  pl players  they they are the new remotes aren't box shaped . Speaker marketing expert: No that's ol old fashioned . Speaker user interface: Well  most of  of them are are somewhat thicker at the end , and get yeah thinner towards the the other end . Speaker industrial designer: but then with some round  round forms in it to fit your hand , Speaker project manager: A it h it has it it has a that's tha th th shape that it fits your hand . Speaker marketing expert: It shouldn't be too boxy , you know . Speaker industrial designer: but  no no I don't mean an entire box like completely square but a also with round edges of course , but in in in at the end it's still this long  box shape with convenient round shapes  to fit . A big recognisable button on top or something . The buttons should also be not too small , not too big , of course , and n not too close together . Speaker marketing expert: But it should be possible to to make it ap apparent that there are two functions for every button . Speaker industrial designer: Yeah of course to to to have icons to explain the different functions . Speaker marketing expert: and maybe we should use colours .",

Speaker industrial designer: I think we have to talk also about the the materials for  Speaker project manager: Well it's just about our first ideas now so I think individually we'll have to come up with ideas for the next meeting about these materials and markets etcetera .

I think . So we'll just get a notice that the the meeting is over . Speaker industrial designer: Yeah now we can still talk about the material , I w wrote down that the case should be plastic of course , hard plastic , the buttons should be rubbery I think . Speaker marketing expert: Yeah it shouldn't be too heavy . Speaker project manager: Well I have had remotes that they had the function of the buttons was about a layer over the buttons Speaker marketing expert:  Are we going w with the front fronts idea ? Speaker project manager: Well I think w we can look into that in the in the next thirty minutes . Speaker marketing expert: and you can always use a front front on it , you know ? You can use it  just plain but you can   To make it more trendy . Speaker project manager: And we should dispatch those kind of fronts fronts a a around the world so  Speaker user interface: Well you can make profit with them , and it's  a way to make them trendy . Speaker industrial designer: Well but th but the standard front will be just grey or something Speaker project manager: Yeah well it has to it h it has to fit the the te television and D_V_D_ set we are going to sell , so if they are black and black black and silver we'll make them black and silver so  Speaker marketing expert: But people of often don't like bright colours or something . We have to make it grey or s or black . Speaker project manager: But that's marketing research you can you can ask .  And you will look into the technical design and form , I think .

First I will tell you something about the findings , what I discovered about the remote control . then I'll have some kind of map , and it's the top of the remote control . The remote control is a very difficult thing to to explain to just all of you wh who haven't seen a remote control inside . there's a lot of plastic on it , because its not so expensive . And there are a lot of wires , which connect the components in it , and there are switches and things like that . There's a lot of small electronics . So it won't be too expensive to build it . Only twelve Euro fifty I think we will make it . And here I have the top of the remote control . here's some kind of chip . on top of this , there are the numbers . you have all on your remote control . And the teletext button . And here's the battery . And when you push the button , it will will be sent to the chip . And the chip will send it to all kind of sub-components . My preferences ? We shouldn't make it too big . also for the cost , we should only put one battery on it . A long-lasting battery . also for the cost , use only plastic . Also because of the cost , not too much buttons on it . We can also make a button with a   menu button . And then that that you will see it on the T_V_ .

Or more functions on the remote . maybe more devices you can influence . a radio or a v a video recorder , V_C_R_ . any ideas about that ? Basic or multifunctional ?

Speaker marketing expert: So I'm gonna have a presentation about the market , we did a usability lab-test with a hundred persons . And we looked at several things . among them design , what frustrations they had while using remote controls . our users , they disliked the look and feel of current remote controls . they especially found found them very ugly . And th they also found them hard to to learn how to use it . well they also zap a lot . And fifty percent of the users only use ten percent of the buttons . So a lot of unused buttons . Well the most used button is the channel selection . The power , volume and channel selections are very relevant . teletext is less relevant but also important . not important they found the audio , that's not the volume but specific the the pitch , or the left or right . the screen and the brightness . And channel settings . th and they also are not used very often . here we can see what the market share is of several groups . Then we have a few graphs about the market . as you can see , most users are between thirty six and forty five . the the the younger group between sixteen and twenty five is not very big . And to come back on the the swapping things , I don't think , I  I think the younger will be most interest in it . in the  we asked them , how would you like a s a new feature . If you have an L_C_D_ on the remote control , what would you think of it . Now you can clearly see young users say  . I will  that would very nice . And older user think they will be scared of change  I think . And another thing , how would you like to have a speech recognition on it . Young users think that's an interesting idea . And old users not . well we found out that there are two  several markets at which we can aim . the first are the younger , the age between sixteen and forty five . they are highly interested in the features , as you can see here . the second group is the older group . Aged between forty six and sixty five . They are less interested in new features . But they spend their money more easily . Well then I come to my personal preferences . yeah the first question is  also we have to ask is at the which market do we aim at . of course n saying we aim at the young group doesn't say that old people won't buy it . What I thought , even young people say it's hard to use , remote control . So if you make a remote control that is very easy to use , that's especially aimed at this group , even the young group will also be more interested . But when use it , I don't know what's good thing of speech recognition . less important functions should be discarded from the remote control . You can find most functions on a T_V_ set . So you don't have to have a lot of audio options , or screen options to change the brightness . And such things . One thing I did not say I think , is that a lot of users also said then I would buy a good looking remote control if there will be one . So the design of our remote control is very important .",
